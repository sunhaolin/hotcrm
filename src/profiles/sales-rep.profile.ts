  // A rep's book of business is private by design (own records + whatever a
  // sharing rule or team grant extends). The objects below carry an explicit
  // `readScope: 'own'` so the intent is authored, not inferred — this both
  // silences the `security-private-no-readscope` liveness warning and pins the
  // behavior: without it, a private-OWD object with allowRead but no scope is
  // an under-specified grant the engine reads as "own only" anyway.
  //
  // What widens that scope today is narrower than it sounds: the territory /
  // account-team rules are authored on `crm_account` ONLY, and a sharing rule
  // widens the object it names — not the records hanging off it. So a rep who
  // receives an account through a territory rule reads that account, while the
  // quotes, contracts and tasks on it stay own-only, and opportunities widen
  // only through the >= $100k leadership rules. Whether those children should
  // follow the account is an open business decision (#549), not a bug in these
  // grants — do not widen them here to paper over it.
  //
  // The `controlled_by_parent` grants below read as narrow, and as of
  // 17.0.0-rc.4 they ARE. MEASURED and pinned by
  // `test/parent-derived-reach.test.ts`: the ADR-0055 derivation resolves master
  // accessibility through the same paths a direct read of the master takes —
  // owner scope AND `sys_record_share` grants, not the master's row-level
  // security policies alone. A rep holding ONE account through a territory rule
  // reads that account's contacts and no others, and reads line items only under
  // the quotes they can reach. Writes derive the same way: a child of a master
  // the rep cannot edit is refused. So each grant below is bounded by the
  // parent's sharing, which is what it looks like.
  //
  // Until 17.0.0-rc.3 the same grants were org-wide reads and this note said so
  // (#694): the derivation consulted master RLS policies only, and HotCRM
  // authors none, so the master set was every record.
  // objectstack-ai/objectstack#5386 fixed that upstream and it shipped in rc.4.

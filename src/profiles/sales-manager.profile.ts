    // (#880). Paired with `requires: ['hierarchy-security']` in
    // `objectstack.config.ts`; the two are one declaration and must move together.
    //
    // THE DEFECT. The object gate said "can edit" and every quote-drafted
    // contract answered 403 anyway. `quote_on_accepted` copies the quote's
    // `owner_id` onto the contract it drafts, so that contract hangs under a
    // REP; `crm_contract` is `private` with an owner field, so
    // `plugin-sharing`'s write gate needs the owner inside the caller's write
    // DEPTH — and depth with no `writeScope` and `modifyAllRecords: false` is
    // `own` (`getEffectiveScope`). A manager could edit only the contracts they
    // had created themselves, which is why this never showed up in a smoke
    // test: it bites only on the real path, where the rep closes the deal and
    // the manager is asked to fix the terms.
    //
    // WHAT THIS DECLARES, AND WHERE IT TAKES EFFECT. Maintainer ruling,
    // 2026-08-11, verbatim: 「本项目是元数据app，在企业版运行就具备企业版相关的
    // 能力，不重复开发。」 This app states the depth it MEANS and lets the edition
    // supply the capability. `own_and_reports` is a HIERARCHY scope resolved by
    // the `hierarchy-scope-resolver` service, which ships only in
    // `@objectstack/security-enterprise`:
    //
    //   - on the ENTERPRISE edition the resolver is present and a Sales Manager
    //     reaches their reports' contracts — the workflow this card is about;
    //   - on the OPEN edition there is no resolver, so
    //     `SharingService.resolveOwnerScopeIds` fails CLOSED to owner-only and a
    //     Sales Manager still gets 403 on a rep's contract.
    //
    // That 403 is an EDITION BOUNDARY, not the #880 defect returning. Do not
    // "fix" it by substituting a broader open-edition value: an earlier revision
    // of this PR used `writeScope: 'org'` for exactly that reason and the ruling
    // rejected it as 重复开发 — approximating an enterprise capability in app
    // metadata instead of declaring the real one. `test/contract-write-depth.test.ts`
    // pins BOTH halves, so the open-edition refusal is asserted rather than
    // merely tolerated, and an edition change becomes visible instead of silent.
    //
    // WHY `own_and_reports` AND NOT `unit_and_below`. The ruling's 「经理能改团队
    // 的合同」 means the manager's REPORTS, and the two scopes resolve through
    // different data (ADR-0057 / ADR-0090 Addendum): `unit` / `unit_and_below`
    // resolve through BUSINESS UNITS — the anchored
    // `sys_user_position.business_unit_id`, falling back to
    // `sys_business_unit_member` — while `own_and_reports` resolves through the
    // MANAGER CHAIN (`ITeamGraphService.managerOf`). HotCRM's metadata mentions
    // business units nowhere at all, so `unit_and_below` would tie this grant to
    // an org topology the app never describes; the manager/rep split it DOES
    // model (`src/sharing/positions.ts`) is a reporting relationship, which is
    // what `own_and_reports` names. Neither scope's data is authored by this app
    // — both are supplied by the deployment — so this is a choice of MEANING,
    // and the reporting line is the meaning the ruling states.
    //
    // Deliberately NOT `modifyAllRecords: true`: depth widens which OWNERS the
    // caller reaches and nothing else, while the Modify All Data bit is a
    // super-user bypass that also skips row-level security, edits ownerless
    // rows, widens DELETE past `checkDelete`, and opens `canManageShares`. This
    // set holds `allowDelete: false` on contracts and must keep holding it.

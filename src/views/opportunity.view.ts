    // `mass_update_stage` is wired as an AGGREGATE bulk def, not as a bare
    // `bulkActions: ['mass_update_stage']` string (#508). The two forms are
    // different dispatch contracts, and only this one moves a whole selection:
    //
    //   - bare string  → per-record fan-out: the action is dispatched ONCE PER
    //     selected row with `recordId` set. N requests, N stage moves.
    //   - aggregate def → ONE dispatch for the whole selection, carrying every
    //     id in the builtin `params._selectedIds` and no `recordId`. One
    //     request, N stage moves, one audit entry.
    //
    // Aggregate is the right shape here because the body already loops over the
    // selection itself, and because the run is all-or-nothing: a partial result
    // rejects instead of leaving the bar reporting per-row success it cannot
    // honour (see the body in `src/actions/opportunity.actions.ts`).
    //
    // `execution: 'aggregate'` is REQUIRED on an `operation: 'custom'` def and
    // is not boilerplate: a custom def without it has no dispatcher, so the
    // button ticks green once per row and does nothing at all. The spec refuses
    // that shape at parse time (#4457) — which is also what makes this
    // declaration safe to trust rather than merely present.
    //
    // History: this list carried the bare-string form until #588 removed it as
    // a silent no-op, and the removal was read as "the platform cannot deliver
    // a selection" for two release candidates. It could: the channel is
    // `params._selectedIds`, the underscore is load-bearing, and nothing was
    // injecting it precisely BECAUSE this declaration was gone
    // (objectstack-ai/objectstack#5568, closed works-as-declared).
    //
    // The def deliberately carries only the three keys that choose the dispatch
    // contract. Label, icon, params (the New Stage picker) and `visible` are
    // promoted from the action itself by the renderer, so the dialog and the
    // toolbar button cannot drift apart — and the label stays i18n-resolved,
    // which an inline `label:` here would not be.

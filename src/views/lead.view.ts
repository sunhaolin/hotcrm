/**
 * ═══ HOUSE RULE: form predicates are `record.`-bound AND TOTAL ═════════════
 *
 * Every `visibleOn` / `visibleWhen` below is a CEL predicate the *renderer*
 * evaluates, and it must satisfy two properties. `test/view-predicate-dialect.test.ts`
 * enforces both against the compiled stack, so you do not have to remember them.
 *
 * 1. **`record.`-bound.** The evaluation context binds field values under the
 *    `record` namespace (`buildScope` in `@objectstack/formula` binds exactly
 *    `record` / `previous` / `input` / `user` / `current_user` / `ctx` / `os`).
 *    A bare field name is an unbound identifier, so it never evaluates:
 *
 *        evaluate('status == "unqualified"',        { record: { status: 'new' } })
 *          → ok:false  type  "Unknown variable: status"       ← for EVERY record
 *        evaluate('record.status == "unqualified"', { record: { status: 'new' } })
 *          → ok:true   false
 *
 * 2. **TOTAL** — the same `has(record.x)` rule AGENTS.md states for
 *    `validations[].condition` / `requiredWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `visibleWhen`
 *    (#630). Prefixing alone is not enough: on a *brand-new* record the key is
 *    absent, and strict CEL aborts on the read:
 *
 *        evaluate('record.duplicate_of_type == "crm_lead"',                { record: {} })
 *          → ok:false  "No such key: duplicate_of_type"
 *        evaluate('has(record.duplicate_of_type) && record.duplicate_of_type == "crm_lead"',
 *                                                                          { record: {} })
 *          → ok:true   false
 *
 * Why both matter here and not only in theory (#688): the console's predicate
 * evaluation **fails OPEN** — an unevaluable `visibleWhen` defaults the field to
 * *visible*, with no diagnostic — and a visible field carries its `required: true`
 * into client-side submit validation. So a predicate that cannot answer does not
 * degrade to "shown but optional"; it makes the form unsatisfiable. On `crm_lead`
 * this rendered all five conditional disqualification fields at once and demanded
 * a new lead be a duplicate of *both* a lead and a contact — mutually exclusive by
 * design — so no lead could be created through the UI at all. The fail-open half
 * is tracked upstream at objectstack-ai/objectstack#5149; these predicates are the
 * half this repo owns, and they must be able to answer.
 *
 * Numeric comparisons carry `!= null` on top of `has(...)`, matching the object
 * files: `has(record.rating) && record.rating != null && record.rating >= 4`.
 * Strict CEL aborts on `dyn<null> < int`, which `has()` alone does not prevent.
 */

/**
 * The duplicate-link block (#598), spread into every form that offers
 * `disqualification_reason`.
 *
 * `duplicate_disqualification_requires_survivor` on `crm_lead` rejects a lead
 * closed as "Duplicate" that does not name the record it duplicates and confirm
 * the match. So the same rule the `disqualification_reason` field itself follows
 * applies one level down: a form that lets a user PICK "Duplicate" must also let
 * them satisfy it, or the save fails with an error the form gives no way to
 * clear. Declared once and reused rather than retyped eight times — the copies
 * would drift, and a form that quietly lost the block is exactly the failure
 * this shape is meant to make impossible.
 *
 * The two lookups mirror the object's `requiredWhen` predicates: each appears
 * only when `duplicate_of_type` names its object — and now says so in the same
 * words, character for character as the `requiredWhen` on those two fields in
 * `lead.object.ts`, so the form shows a lookup exactly when the server will
 * demand it. `test/view-predicate-dialect.test.ts` pins the two together.

     * line is what stamps the 1-day follow-up SLA and fires the "Hot lead —
     * assign within 24h" alert at the owner, so this queue must hold precisely
     * the leads that alert is about. (An earlier comment here credited a
     * flagging workflow that has never existed in this repo — dead name
     * removed, the routing flow is the producer.)
     *
     * The cut was `rating >= 4.5` (#766). `rating` is a WHOLE-star field —
     * `lead.hook.ts` rounds its computed score ("round to WHOLE stars"), the
     * `star_rating` widget offers nothing finer, and the one seeded 4.5 was
     * deleted for the same reason (#591) — so `>= 4.5` meant `== 5` on every
     * row that can actually exist. A 4-star lead was routed hot, alerted on,
     * and then missing from the queue its owner was sent to.
     *
     * Sharing the population with "High Priority" is the deliberate cost of
     * having one definition of hot, not an oversight: both views now show
     * rating >= 4, still New or Contacted. What differs is what they are FOR.
     * Hot Leads is the work order — sorted by next-follow-up (the SLA that
     * routing just stamped), with phone, email and owner on the row so it can
     * be dialled top to bottom. High Priority is the scan list — score-tinted
     * rows and lead source, no SLA column, no time ordering. A 5-star-only
     * queue, if it is ever a real need, gets its own view under its own name
     * instead of squatting on "Hot".

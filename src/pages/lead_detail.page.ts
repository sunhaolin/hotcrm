        // `lead_duplicate_check` (lead.hook.ts, job 2) already writes
        // `duplicate_status: 'suspected'` and links the record the lead repeats
        // — the flag existed, and this page never read it. A rep opened a
        // flagged lead, saw a page identical to a clean one, and converted it
        // into a second account, contact and opportunity. These banners and the
        // `duplicates` section on the Details tab are the record-page half of
        // that fix — the banner is the alarm, the section is the link to
        // compare against; the conversion screen carries the other half.
        //
        // ## Why there are TWO of them (#1628)
        //
        // #1207 shipped one banner gated on `== "suspected"`, which left the
        // STRONGER state silent. #1289 widened the predicate to every verdict
        // and, being one component, had to pick copy that named NEITHER state:
        // a `record:alert` carries a single `visible` and a single title/body
        // pair, and `pickLocalized` picks by LANGUAGE, not by row — so naming
        // one verdict would have mislabelled every lead in the other.
        //
        // That was correct for one banner, and it is why one banner is not
        // enough. Since #1288 the two verdicts have OPPOSITE next steps:
        //
        //   suspected — the intake hook's guess. Conversion PROCEEDS; the rep
        //               should compare against the linked record first.
        //   confirmed — a reviewer's verdict. Conversion is REFUSED outright
        //               (`lead-conversion.flow.ts`, `refuse_confirmed_duplicate`).
        //
        // One sentence cannot state either without being false for the other,
        // so it stated neither, and the rep had to scroll to the Duplicate
        // Status chip to learn which situation they were in. A banner that
        // announces something is wrong but not what to do is not doing the one
        // job a banner has. Two components, two predicates, two next steps.
        //
        // ⚠️ Two sibling `record:alert` nodes really do BOTH render: a region
        // renders as `components.map((node, i) => <SchemaRenderer key={node?.id
        // || fallback} …>)` — read out of the shipped console bundle at the
        // `.objectui-sha` pin — so each is mounted separately and evaluates its
        // own `visible` against the same row. Their `id`s are their React keys,
        // which is why the two ids differ rather than sharing one.
        //
        // ⚠️ `visible` is the ONE record component whose PROPS carry a real row
        // predicate: `record-alert.tsx` evaluates `properties.visible` through
        // `toPredicateInput` + `useCondition` against the row
        // (`usePredicateRecordContext`), the same pipeline as an action button.
        // A node-level `visibleWhen` would be a different gate one tier up,
        // evaluated by `SchemaRenderer` on `data` = the data-source ADAPTER,
        // not the row — it cannot see `duplicate_status` at all.
        //
        // ⚠️ `has()` is load-bearing, and this surface is the WORST of the four
        // this repo measures (cf. `test/view-predicate-dialect.test.ts`): the
        // renderer's call site is FAIL-SOFT — an unevaluable predicate answers
        // SHOWN. So a bare `record.duplicate_status == "suspected"` would abort
        // with `No such key` on every clean lead whose driver omits the column
        // (`driver-memory` / `driver-mongodb`; `driver-sql` returns it as null)
        // and put a duplicate warning on leads that are not duplicates. The
        // guard is what makes the predicate answer `false` instead of faulting.
        // Pinned on the real engine in `test/lead-duplicate-visibility.test.ts`.
        //
        // ⛔ And the guard is NOT the whole predicate — `has()` ALONE is wrong
        // here, in either shape. It is TRUE for a key that is PRESENT AND NULL,
        // which is precisely what `driver-sql` hands back for a clean lead
        // (measured: `has(record.duplicate_status)` against
        // `{ duplicate_status: null }` answers `{ ok: true, value: true }`), so
        // the guard needs a comparison beside it or the banner cries wolf on
        // every clean lead. #1289, covering both verdicts at once, spelled that
        // comparison `&& … != null`. A per-verdict banner spells it with the
        // EQUALITY, which is strictly narrower and subsumes it: measured on
        // this engine, `null == "suspected"` is a clean `false`, not a fault,
        // and the two spellings agree on every record shape a driver can
        // produce. Both halves of the shape #1289 ruled for are intact — the
        // `has()` guard verbatim, and a comparison that makes "set" mean set —
        // and the comparison got STRICTER, which is the point of the split. The
        // same spelling already ships one file over, on this same field: the
        // conversion flow's `e21` / `e25` edges (#1288) read
        // `has(vars.leadRecord.duplicate_status) && … == "suspected"`.
        //
        // ⛔ Neither half may be simplified away. Both are pinned, shape by
        // shape, including the reverse pin that the unguarded tail really does
        // fault.
        //
        // `P` — an explicit `{ dialect: 'cel' }` envelope — is not decoration
        // either: `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluateCondition` routes ONLY the
        // envelope to `@objectstack/formula`'s CEL engine, where `has()` is a
        // real function; a bare string takes the legacy JS path, whose
        // `FormulaFunctions` has no CEL `has()`, so the guard would itself be
        // the fault that fails soft to visible.
        //
        // `title` / `body` carry inline locale maps rather than plain strings:
        // this renderer resolves both through `pickLocalized(…, language)`
        // (the same capability `opportunity_detail.page.ts` records under
        // #972), and `body` has no other channel — the i18n extractor's
        // per-component copy keys are title/description/label/placeholder/
        // emptyText/submitLabel, so a plain-string `body` would ship English to
        // all four locales. Keeping both halves of one banner's copy in one
        // place beats splitting `title` into the locale packs.
        //
        // ⭐ Each banner's copy NAMES ITS OWN VERDICT, in the vocabulary the
        // `duplicate_status` chip below publishes, and never the other one —
        // pinned against the option labels read out of the locale packs in
        // `test/lead-duplicate-visibility.test.ts`, so renaming an option
        // re-aims the assertion rather than retiring it.
        // Demo (epic #2): the two duplicate banners (`lead_duplicate_alert_suspected` /
        // `lead_duplicate_alert_confirmed`) are left out on this branch — measured on
        // the demo console, both rendered on every lead regardless of `duplicate_status`
        // (null included), which would open the 线索 scene under a red banner. They
        // ship unchanged on `main`; see `test/lead-duplicate-visibility.test.ts`.

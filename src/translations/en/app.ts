/**
 * English (en) — every translation namespace EXCEPT `objects`:

 *
 * SPLIT AXIS (#1311): translation NAMESPACE first, then CRM DOMAIN FAMILY.
 * Everything that is not `objects` lives in `./app.ts`; `objects` — 69-78% of
 * every bundle — is one file per CRM domain family, and a detail object
 * follows its master. A new row goes in the file for ITS family, never in
 * whichever file is already open: that is how one file re-grows past the 70%
 * advisory band `pnpm hygiene` prints. Full rule and rationale:
 * `src/translations/en.ts`.
 *
 * A namespace `TranslationData` gains later lands here too, and the room is
 * measured: this file is the smaller half of the bundle, and the schema bounds
 * how many namespaces can ever arrive.

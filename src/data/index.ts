/**
 * CRM Seed Data — the aggregating export.
 *
 * Demo records for all core CRM objects, authored per object family in the
 * `*.seed.ts` modules below and collected here as the single `CrmSeedData`
 * array `objectstack.config.ts` registers. Uses `defineSeed()` for type-safe
 * field name checking at compile time.
 *
 * The families were one 100KB module until #635: it sat ~1.5KB under the
 * `pnpm hygiene` byte cap, so the next demo record — the billing addresses of
 * #638 — would have failed the build, and the cheapest way out would have been
 * deleting the explanatory comments the cap exists to protect. Where to add a
 * record now follows from the object:
 *
 *   - `_shared.ts`      seed doctrine + helpers used by more than one family
 *   - `catalog.seed.ts` products, and the catalogue price lookup
 *   - `sales.seed.ts`   accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, opp lines
 *   - `service.seed.ts` tasks, cases, knowledge articles, events + attendees
 *   - `marketing.seed.ts` campaigns, campaign members
 *   - `revenue.seed.ts` contracts, quotes, quote lines, forecasts

/**
 * Ownership and CRM positions are NOT seeded here — they can't be.
 *
 * A seed can't name a user. Lookup values are resolved against the target's
 * externalId and that only works for objects in the app's own graph, so
 * `owner_id: 'Dev Admin'` would store the literal string rather than an id (verified:
 * a `sys_user_position` row seeded that way is unmatchable by the real user
 * id), and `cel\`os.user.id\`` inside a seed evaluates to nothing. The id does
 * not exist until first boot.
 *
 * The `demo_bootstrap` scheduled flow (`src/flows/demo-bootstrap.flow.ts`)
 * does it at the only moment it can: once the first real user exists, its
 * periodic sweep claims every ownerless seeded record for that user.
 *
 * That sweep owns the app's ONE ownership column, `owner_id` (#548 retired the
 * app-authored `owner` lookup that used to sit beside it — the #622 split).
 * Seed writes run under `{ isSystem: true }`, which short-circuits the security
 * middleware, so its insert-time auto-stamp of `owner_id` never fires — "seeds
 * either declare those fields explicitly per record" — and per the paragraph
 * above these seeds cannot declare it. So a seeded row reaches the database
 * owned by nobody at the PLATFORM level (`owner_id` null), and under
 * `sharingModel: 'private'` such a row is editable by no one at all, admin
 * included. Nothing here should grow an `owner_id` seed value to paper over
 * that: the sweep is the mechanism, and `test/flow-scheduled.test.ts` holds it
 * to leaving no claimed object ownerless.

// ─────────────────────────────────────── the SaaS / multi-org composition ──

/**
 * Which SHAPE of this app a build assembles (#1361).
 *
 * `default` is the community/single-org app and is what every build produces
 * unless something asks otherwise — the demo org, its storytelling data, and
 * the `demo_bootstrap` sweep that binds that data to the first user.
 *
 * `saas` is the shape a multi-org operator deploys on the enterprise runtime
 * under a walled tenancy posture (`OS_TENANCY_POSTURE=isolated`). The two
 * differ ONLY by what the composition registers; no code branches at runtime,
 * nothing is decided per tenant, and no enterprise package is imported. See
 * {@link SaasTenantSeedData} for why the seed set shrinks and
 * `objectstack.config.ts` for the flow/permission halves.

 * The refusal is the point, and it is why this is a function rather than a
 * `=== 'saas'` comparison at the one call site. The failure mode a silent
 * default produces is not "the build is a bit wrong": `HOTCRM_COMPOSITION=sass`
 * would assemble the FULL demo union, and the operator would only find out when
 * every tenant they onboard receives nine accounts named after other people's
 * companies — a data-shape mistake that is expensive to unwind once tenants
 * have edited those rows. An unrecognised value therefore throws at
 * config-load time, where a build fails loudly and nothing has shipped.
 *
 * Unset and empty both mean `default`, deliberately: "no opinion" is the
 * community app, so no existing build, script or CI job changes behaviour by
 * saying nothing (`pnpm build`, `objectstack validate`, the cloud EE rigs'
 * `scripts/build-hotcrm-artifact.sh`).

/**
 * The seed datasets a SaaS tenant gets: the product CATALOGUE, and nothing else.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-27 (objectstack#12701, quoted untranslated):
 * 「每个租户应该各自使用各自的数据吧」 — every tenant uses its own data, the
 * product catalogue included; and 「种子也不应该是全局的呀，因为种子数据不同的客户
 * 都是要改的呀，只是参考呀，租户要自己删除呀」 — a seed is a per-tenant
 * REFERENCE copy the tenant edits and deletes.
 *
 * The platform already replays per tenant: `@objectstack/runtime`'s
 * `seed-replayer` replays the registered dataset union into each newly founded
 * organization stamped with that organization's id. What it has no notion of is
 * WHICH families to replay — it always replays the whole union — so the
 * selection is made HERE, once, at composition time. That is also the shape the
 * ruling wants: uniform for every tenant, with no per-tenant opt-in mechanism
 * to author, mis-set, or support.
 *
 * Why the catalogue and only the catalogue:
 *
 *  - A catalogue is the one family that is genuinely a starting point. A new
 *    tenant needs priceable products before they can quote anything, and the
 *    rows are theirs to rename, re-price and delete.
 *  - `sales` / `service` / `marketing` / `revenue` are STORYTELLING: Acme
 *    Corporation's pipeline, nine escalated cases, a finished campaign. Landing
 *    those in a paying tenant's org is not a helpful head start, it is someone
 *    else's data in their CRM.
 *  - It is also the family with no outgoing references, so the shrink cannot
 *    strand a lookup: `catalog.seed.ts` resolves nothing against another
 *    object, while every other family points at accounts, contacts or products
 *    by natural key.
 *
 * ⛔ Not a place to grow a "starter data" bundle. A family added here ships
 * into every tenant of every SaaS deployment; the bar is "a tenant cannot
 * operate without it", not "it looks nice on day one".

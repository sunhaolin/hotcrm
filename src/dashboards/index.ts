 * Dashboard Definitions Barrel
 *
 * ## Two i18n surfaces on a dashboard, and only one of them resolves (#1822)
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` types BOTH `GlobalFilterSchema.label` and
 * `ChartAxisSchema.title` as `I18nLabelSchema` — `z.union([z.string(),
 * InlineLocaleMapSchema])` — so both accept `{ en, 'zh-CN', … }`. Only the
 * filter half is resolved against the viewer's locale. Measured on the pinned
 * `@objectstack/console@17.4.0`, driving the real Console in Chromium, not
 * read off a docblock:
 *
 *   - FILTER `label` and static option `label` → locale-aware. The renderer
 *     calls the inline-map resolver with the active language, so `zh-CN`
 *     renders the `zh-CN` value and `ja-JP` the `ja-JP` one. This is the
 *     spelling every `globalFilters[]` entry in this folder uses.
 *   - AXIS `title` → NOT locale-aware. The axis normaliser flattens the map
 *     with `Object.values(map).find(v => typeof v === 'string')` — the FIRST
 *     value, whatever the viewer's locale. Measured both ways: with `en`
 *     first a `zh-CN` browser rendered the English; with `'zh-CN'` first an
 *     `en` browser rendered the Chinese. So an inline map on an axis does not
 *     translate anything, it just makes the one hardcoded string harder to
 *     read. ⛔ Do not write one — the axis titles in this folder stay plain
 *     English strings until the platform resolves them, and dropping the
 *     `title` renders no axis title at all rather than a translated fallback.
 *
 * ⚠️ `GlobalFilterSchema.object` — documented upstream as resolving a
 * filter's field and option labels through `fields.<object>.<field>` — is
 * INERT in this Console build. Measured: a filter carrying `object` and no
 * `label` rendered the raw field name (`type`, not 类型) and left its option
 * labels English. The definition builder never copies `object` out of the
 * authored filter. ⛔ Do not reach for it instead of an inline map.

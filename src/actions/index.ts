 * Action Definitions Barrel

 * Exports CRM action metadata. Every action ships an inline metadata
 * `body` (sandboxed JS) so the AppPlugin auto-binds the handler at
 * boot — no imperative `engine.registerAction(...)` wiring is needed.
 *
 * `ConvertLeadAction` is the only exception: it is a `flow`-typed
 * action and the screen flow under `src/flows/lead-conversion.flow.ts`
 * carries the implementation.

/**
 * Activity-logging actions — `log_call`, `log_meeting`, `schedule_meeting`.
 *
 * (The file is still named `global.actions.ts` for import stability; nothing
 * here is a *global* action any more, and nothing can be — see the dispatcher
 * note on `objectName` below.)
 *
 * # The two rules this family exists to hold
 *
 *  1. **Scope.** The actions are GENERATED per object: one registered action
 *     per (kind × object). ⛔ Never pin an activity action to a single object,
 *     and never author one without an `objectName` — the runtime keys the
 *     registry on `<objectName>:<action.name>` and the dispatcher probes
 *     `<objectName>` first, so a single-object action is unreachable from every
 *     other object a rep sells to, and an object-less one is unreachable
 *     everywhere.
 *  2. **Shape.** Each of these actions inserts a real `crm_event`, real
 *     `crm_event_attendee` rows, and keeps the `sys_activity` row purely as the
 *     unified-timeline pointer (ADR-0052 `source_object` / `source_id`), the
 *     same way `send_email` points at its `sys_email`. ⛔ Never move that
 *     structure back into a `metadata` JSON blob: a blob is not data — no view
 *     filters it, no dataset groups by it, no report counts it.
 *
 * # Live platform workaround
 *
 * `schedule_meeting` collects its start as a `date` + `time` PAIR rather than
 * as one `datetime` param, because a `datetime` action param cannot be
 * submitted from the Console at all (objectstack-ai/objectstack#5061). Both the
 * body and the param list carry the full reasoning and the revert instruction.
 *
 * The recency bubble (`crm_account.last_activity_date`,
 * `crm_lead.last_contacted_date`, `crm_contact.last_contacted_date`) is
 * deliberately NOT written here. It hangs off `crm_event`'s own hook, so an
 * event created from the calendar, from an import, or from a future flow bumps
 * recency exactly like one created from this button. One writer, not one per
 * entry point.
 */

/**
 * `objectName` → the object's DECLARED `nameField`, derived from the object
 * definitions rather than hand-listed.
 *
 * ⛔ Never stamp `record_label` from `ctx.record?.name`: `name` is not the
 * display field on almost anything here — most objects declare a different
 * `nameField` (`display_title`, `full_name`, `subject`, `contract_number`, …)
 * and have no `name` column at all, so the label lands `null`.
 *
 * Deriving the map keeps it correct when an object retargets its `nameField`.
 * The lookup happens at AUTHORING time (each action knows its own object), so
 * the body carries the resolved field name rather than a table it could miss
 * on.

 * # Why a string and not a function
 *
 * An action body is shipped BODY-ONLY and evaluated in a QuickJS sandbox with
 * no module scope, so a shared helper called from a body is not a closure at
 * runtime — it is a `ReferenceError` (`test/helpers/action-sandbox.ts` states
 * the same constraint for the shared line-item price fill). A string spliced at
 * AUTHORING time, while Node builds the metadata, has no such problem: what
 * reaches the sandbox is one self-contained body with this text inlined,
 * exactly as if it had been typed there. `test/action-sandbox.test.ts` executes
 * both bodies under the real runner AND pins that both still contain this
 * constant, so the two call sites cannot drift into disagreeing.
 *
 * # Contract for a splice site
 *
 * Splice into a body that has already declared `userId` (`ctx.user?.id ?? null`)
 * and whose action declares `api.read`. Afterwards `actorName` holds a
 * non-blank display name — the id only as a last resort, never `null`.

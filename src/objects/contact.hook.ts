/**
 * Contact integrity hook.
 *
 * - On insert/update, dedupes by `email` WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION — matching
 *   the constraint the schema actually declares. `crm_contact.email` carries
 *   field-level `unique: true`, which materializes as the tenant composite
 *   `(organization_id, email)` (framework#3696), so the address is unique
 *   across every account of one organization and two organizations may each
 *   know the same person. The lookup is deliberately NOT account-scoped (the
 *   old per-account lookup let a cross-account duplicate sail past the
 *   friendly check and explode on the DB index instead, mid-conversion) — but
 *   it must not reach ACROSS organizations either.
 *
 *   ## What an unscoped lookup cost, as measured
 *
 *   `ctx.api` reads are not organization-scoped for every caller: the seed
 *   loader replays a dataset per organization as a SYSTEM write, and an
 *   unscoped `findOne({ where: { email } })` from inside that replay meets the
 *   FIRST organization's contacts. On the deployment shape where many
 *   organizations share one database, the second organization's replay was
 *   refused row by row — `Another contact (…) with email
 *   john.smith@acme.example.com already exists.` — landing 0 of 9 contacts
 *   and, because `crm_contract` requires one, 0 of 4 contracts, plus
 *   half-populated quotes, quote line items, campaign members and event
 *   attendees. Nothing leaked; the tenant wall held. The data never arrived.
 *
 *   The organization is therefore resolved before the lookup, in the blessed
 *   order: the acting user's active organization first (`user.organizationId`
 *   === `session.organizationId` === the `organization_id` column === RLS's
 *   `current_user.organizationId`), then the row's own stamp, which is what a
 *   system write carries when no session does. Resolved: scope the lookup.
 *   Unresolvable on a system write: skip the friendly guard and let the
 *   `(organization_id, email)` index enforce. Unresolvable for a USER write:
 *   an untenanted (community) install, where the old global lookup is right.
 * - On delete, refuses if the contact is referenced by an active opportunity,
 *   open quote or active contract.
 *
 * ⛔ No email/phone propagation to opportunities: `crm_opportunity` has no
 * `contact_email` / `contact_phone` columns, and a rollup writing nonexistent
 * fields is silently swallowed. Opportunities reach the live values through
 * their `primary_contact` lookup.

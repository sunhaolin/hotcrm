    // SECOND `owner` lookup beside it — reassigning that moves the record in
    // every list and report and moves no access at all.
    //
    // ⚠️ Declared rather than left to injection, which the platform supports
    // explicitly ("author-declared fields with the same name always win over
    // injection, no overwrite"). Three things only a declaration buys:
    //   • `os validate` resolves it. An injected column is invisible to every
    //     author-time rule, so `highlightFields: ['owner_id']` is reported as
    //     "not a field on this object — silently skipped by every consumer",
    //     and a CEL predicate reading `record.owner_id` fails outright.
    //   • the per-object label and `group` survive (an injected field carries
    //     the generic label "Owner" and no group at all);
    //   • `trackHistory` survives, so a transfer still renders on the record
    //     timeline instead of only in the compliance audit log.
    // `system: true` keeps the injected marker the platform's own tooling
    // reads — notably the clone path, which strips system columns so a copy is
    // stamped to the cloner rather than inheriting the source's owner.
    //
    // No `defaultValue`: the security middleware stamps `owner_id` to the

    /**
     * Case- and whitespace-folded copy of `name` — the key lead conversion
     * matches accounts on.
     *
     * ### Why a stored column, and not any of the cheaper shapes
     *
     * ⚠️ Three cheaper fixes are all dead ends, and each is a live platform
     * constraint. `test/account-name-normalized-match.test.ts` re-measures every
     * one so this note cannot quietly go stale:
     *
     * - **A flow cannot normalize.** `service-automation`'s `resolveToken`
     *   understands exactly one function form, `/^(NOW|TODAY)\s*\(\s*\)…/`.
     *   `{LOWER(x)}`, `{TRIM(x)}` and `{x.toLowerCase()}` all resolve to
     *   `undefined` (every bare identifier is substituted before the expression
     *   is evaluated, so no string method is reachable), and an unwrapped
     *   `LOWER({x})` interpolates literally to `"LOWER(Acme Corp)"`.
     * - **A formula field cannot be the match key.** `driver-sql`'s
     *   `fieldHasColumn` returns false for `type: 'formula'`, so a computed
     *   value has no physical column and nothing can filter on it.
     * - **`$regex` is not an answer.** On `driver-sql` it does not run as a
     *   regex at all: it compiles to `LIKE '%value%'`, a SUBSTRING match, so
     *   `"Acme Corp"` also matches `"Not Acme Corp Ltd"`. It cannot collapse
     *   internal whitespace, the leading wildcard defeats the index, and on the
     *   in-memory driver it does compile user-controlled text into a `RegExp`.
     *
     * So the canonical form is established by the PRODUCER at write time — the
     * same doctrine `crm_lead.email` / `crm_contact.email` follow — and the
     * reader does a plain, indexed equality match. The other side of that
     * comparison is `crm_lead.company_normalized`, which exists for the same
     * reason: a flow can compare two stored columns, it cannot compute either.
     *
     * ### What it holds
     *
     * `name`, trimmed, lower-cased, with runs of internal whitespace collapsed
     * to one space. Nothing else — normalize-then-EXACT. Fuzzy matching
     * (punctuation folding, legal-suffix stripping, edit distance) is
     * deliberately out of scope; it turns a lookup into a ranking problem and
     * needs a human review affordance this app does not have.
     *
     * Derived, never authored: `account.hook.ts` recomputes it on every write
     * that carries `name`, and leaves it alone otherwise. `readonly` keeps
     * user/API writes off it (INSERT is exempt from the strip and UPDATE strips
     * only CALLER-supplied keys, so the hook's own write always survives);
     * `hidden` keeps a machine-owned column out of forms and pickers — the same
     * pairing `crm_forecast.seed_key` uses.

     * ### Why the flat column exists — the trap that catches every rule
     * ### authored against an `address`
     *
     * ⚠️ `billing_address` is an `address` field: the platform stores the whole
     * {street, city, state, postalCode, country, countryCode, formatted} value
     * in ONE column. A sharing rule's CEL condition is compiled to a
     * pushdown-able `FilterCondition` by `compileCelToFilter`, and that compiler
     * rejects every path reaching INSIDE such a value:
     *
     *     record.billing_address.country in ["US","CA","MX"]
     *       → unsupported: cross-object/nested field path
     *         "record.billing_address.country" is not pushdown-able
     *
     * `plugin-sharing` then refuses to seed the rule rather than degrade it to
     * match-all, so the rule is dropped on every boot and its recipients get
     * nothing at all. Measured: the blocker is the NESTED PATH, not the
     * `in [...]` operator — `in [...]`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `&&`, `||`, `!`,
     * `startsWith()` and `== null` all compile fine against a FLAT field.
     * Rewriting the condition as a disjunction of `==` therefore does NOT help;
     * only a flat column does. `test/sharing-seeding.test.ts` measures that
     * matrix instead of assuming it.
     *
     * ### What it holds
     *
     * `billing_address.country`, trimmed, internal whitespace collapsed, and
     * upper-cased — nothing else. It is what was TYPED, so it is still free
     * text and still capable of holding `Deutschland`. Nothing matches against
     * it: `territory` below classifies it, and an unrecognised spelling lands in
     * a stated `other`. `countryCode` is deliberately not consulted; see the
     * note in `account.hook.ts` for why the ISO slot is not the input.

    /**
     * Territory — the declared value the territory sharing rules filter on.

     * ### Why a select and not the country
     *
     * Matching free-text `billing_country` against a list of country codes
     * inside a CEL string means an account whose address reads `United States`
     * belongs to NO territory, silently — the metadata says territory sharing
     * works and for that account it does nothing, with no error anywhere. A
     * `select` makes the domain knowable: three values, declared, every one
     * reachable, and an account outside the staffed territories says `other`
     * rather than nothing.
     *
     * It also collapses four copies of the country list (two CEL strings and
     * six localised documentation tables) into one authored table in
     * `./_territory.ts`. Adding a country is a line there; the sharing rules,
     * this picklist and the docs all follow, and
     * `test/territory-single-source.test.ts` fails if any of them does not.

     * ### Readonly, and always stated

     * authored — correcting an account's territory means correcting its
     * address, which keeps ONE fact behind the classification. Every insert

    // 1. Per-tenant uniqueness of account names is already declared on the
    //    `name` field. A unique `name_normalized` would SUBSUME it (equal names
    //    normalize equally) and force that constraint to be re-decided.
    // 2. This column is a MATCH key, not a policy. Rejecting a near-duplicate
    //    name outright is a separate data-quality decision, and this repo has
    //    already chosen the soft shape for that question once (the hard unique
    //    on `crm_lead.email` was removed because refusing a repeat enquiry is
    //    worse than recording it).
    // 3. ⚠️ Measured hazard: `create_index` FAILS on any deployment already
    //    holding `Acme Corp` and `ACME  Corp` separately, so a unique index
    //    could not be an upgrade step without a merge pass first. That hazard
    //    is bounded today ONLY because this repo's deployment shape is fresh
    //    installs — see docs/MAINTENANCE.md §3.3. The conclusion is conditional
    //    on that premise, not universal.
    //
    // Consequence, recorded rather than hidden: two accounts CAN still hold the
    // same normalized name if something outside the flow creates them, and
    // `get_record` has no `sort` option, so the conversion would reuse an
    // arbitrary one. Reusing one of N is still better than creating the N+1th.

/**
 * Event lifecycle hooks (#592).
 *
 * - `event_schedule_derive` keeps `start_datetime` / `end_datetime` /
 *   `duration_minutes` mutually consistent, so a calendar view and a duration
 *   report cannot disagree about the same row.
 * - `event_activity_bubble` is the app's PRIMARY writer of interaction
 *   recency: a `held` event stamps `crm_account.last_activity_date`,
 *   `crm_lead.last_contacted_date` and `crm_contact.last_contacted_date`,
 *   walking UP from an opportunity / case / contact to the account it hangs
 *   off. Since #595 it is also the SINGLE writer of
 *   `crm_case.first_response_date` (see the block at the end of the handler).
 *
 * # Why the walk-up matters
 *
 * `at_risk_accounts` and `customer_churn_signals` are built on
 * `crm_account.last_activity_date`, but a rep logs a call on the OPPORTUNITY or
 * the CONTACT — almost never on the account row itself. ⛔ Bubbling only to the
 * directly-named record leaves the account clock untouched through an entire
 * sales cycle, and the churn report then counts a busy customer as silent. The
 * walk-up is the whole reason the signal becomes real.

/**
 * `do_not_call` — the calendar half of the same promise.
 *
 * `crm_task` carries the follow-up a rep OWES; `crm_event` carries the slot a
 * rep BOOKS. A `planned` event of type `call` is a booked outbound phone call,
 * so it is refused against a person flagged `do_not_call` for exactly the
 * reasons stated on `task_do_not_call_guard` in `src/objects/task.hook.ts`
 * (read that block first — it carries the full rationale for enforcing on the
 * write rather than on a button, and for scoping to the phone).
 *
 * The status split is what makes this guard honest, and it is the whole reason
 * `log_call` needs no gate of its own:
 *
 *   - `status: 'held'`   — the call HAPPENED. Allowed, always. This is what
 *     `log_call` writes, and refusing it would hide evidence of a call rather
 *     than prevent one.
 *   - `status: 'planned'` — the call is BOOKED. Refused.
 *
 * `schedule_meeting` is deliberately NOT caught here: it hardcodes
 * `type: 'meeting'`, and a person who does not want phone calls may still be
 * met in person or over video. Gating it would widen `do_not_call` into
 * `do_not_contact`.

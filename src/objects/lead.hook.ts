 * Lead automation hook.
 *
 * - Auto-scores incoming leads into `rating` (1-5) using industry/title/email/phone weights.
 * - Refuses edits to a converted lead — but not the engine's reference cleanup,
 *   so a converted lead never makes its conversion products undeletable.
 * - When status flips to `qualified`, schedules a follow-up `crm_task` for the current user.
 * - Normalizes `email` and flags a re-captured address as a suspected duplicate.

// ⚠️ The scoring constants and `computeRating` live INSIDE `lead_automation`'s

// copy is dead code that silently diverges from the copy that actually runs.

/**
 * Lead auto-assignment (load-balanced round-robin).
 *
 * A lead created without an owner (CSV import, web-to-lead, API capture) is
 * assigned to the sales rep with the FEWEST open leads — a self-balancing
 * round-robin that needs no rotation counter. It writes `owner_id`, the platform
 * ownership anchor that OWD, sharing and the "My Leads" view all read, so the
 * assigned rep really owns the lead rather than merely being named on it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Writing a FOREIGN owner is normally an ownership transfer, denied without
 * `allowTransfer` (#3004). It passes here because of WHERE this runs, not what
 * it is granted: a `beforeInsert` hook mutates `opCtx.data` INSIDE the operation
 * the security middleware already wrapped, so the guard read (and stamped) the
 * payload before this line changed it. `test/ownership-model.test.ts` pins that
 * ordering against a real ObjectQL — an assumption here would be the difference
 * between round-robin working and every web-to-lead submission 403-ing.
 *
 * The rep pool is whoever holds the `sales_rep` position (`sys_user_position`).
 * When that pool is empty (a fresh org before positions are assigned) the hook
 * is a NO-OP and the lead keeps whatever owner it had — it never blocks lead
 * creation. UI-created leads already carry `owner_id` = creator (the
 * middleware's insert-time stamp), so this only fires on genuinely ownerless
 * intake.
 *
 * Runs beforeInsert so the downstream `lead_assignment` flow (afterInsert) sees
 * the assigned owner and routes its SLA alert to that rep.
 *
 * ⚠️ Priority 250 — hooks run in ASCENDING priority order, so this must run
 * AFTER `lead_automation` (200), whose guest branch strips a client-spoofed
 * `owner_id` from anonymous Web-to-Lead submissions. Assigning first and being
 * stripped afterwards lands every web-to-lead ownerless — the exact case this
 * hook exists for.

/**
 * Soft lead dedupe.
 *
 * A prospect who enquires twice must not be REJECTED — a re-captured address is
 * recorded as a fact instead of refused, so the public Web-to-Lead form never
 * answers a returning visitor with a save error.
 *
 * Four jobs, all `before`-phase so the values land in the same write:
 *
 * 1. **Normalize `email`** (trim + lowercase), exactly as `contact_integrity`
 *    does on `crm_contact`. ⚠️ This is what makes the dedupe lookup below a
 *    plain equality match: there is no case-insensitive predicate to lean on —
 *    ObjectQL's `$regex` compiles to a LIKE *substring* on SQL, which would
 *    match `a@b.com` inside `xa@b.com` — so the canonical form has to be
 *    established by the PRODUCER at write time rather than worked around by
 *    every reader. Also on update: an edit reintroducing mixed case would
 *    silently make the record invisible to every later dedupe.
 *
 * 1b. **Fold `company` into `company_normalized`** — a SEPARATE column, not an
 *    in-place rewrite, because `company` is the display value the conversion
 *    flow copies onto the account it creates. It is the lead half of the pair
 *    `crm_account.name_normalized` completes, and it exists for the same reason
 *    as the email fold: the reader (a flow template) can compare two stored
 *    columns but cannot compute either one.
 *
 * 2. **Link a repeated address to the record it repeats** — on insert only.
 *    An existing `crm_contact` wins over an open lead: the prospect who already
 *    became a contact is the further-along record, and the one the conversion
 *    flow would reuse anyway. Within a kind the OLDEST record wins, so a cluster
 *    of five re-submissions all point at the same origin instead of chaining.
 *
 * 3. **Retire the whole claim when the record it named is gone** — on update
 *    only, and the exact mirror of job 2: the hook that stamps a duplicate link
 *    is the one that takes it back down. See the note at the block itself.
 *
 * The write is `duplicate_status: 'suspected'` — a machine's guess, explicitly
 * distinguished from the `confirmed` verdict a human records when disqualifying
 * as a duplicate. The hook stands down on any record that already carries a
 * verdict, so `confirmed` can never be reverted to `suspected` by a later
 * write, and on any record that already names a survivor.
 *
 * Detection is INSERT-only by design: a later edit re-scanning would re-open a
 * question a human may have already closed, and the review queue
 * (`suspected_duplicates`) is the affordance for anything intake missed.
 *
 * ⚠️ Priority 300 — after `lead_automation` (200), whose guest branch strips
 * client-supplied `duplicate_*` from anonymous submissions. Running earlier
 * would let a spoofed `duplicate_status` switch this hook off.

    //     ⚠️ Platform constraint. `duplicate_of_type` is a DISCRIMINATOR, and
    //     `lead.object.ts` pairs it with the lookup it names through
    //     `requiredWhen` — so "the type is set" and "that lookup is populated"
    //     are ONE fact stated in two columns. Neither lookup declares a
    //     `deleteBehavior`, so both take the spec default `set_null`, and the
    //     engine implements `set_null` by UPDATING the row that HOLDS the
    //     lookup. Deleting the contact (or lead) a lead was flagged against
    //     therefore arrives here as `{ id, duplicate_of_<x>: null, … }`, nulls
    //     one half of the pair, and the row instantly breaks its own rule — so
    //     the whole delete rolls back with `Duplicate Of Contact is required`,
    //     an error naming a field on an object the caller never addressed.
    //
    //     The blast radius is why this matters: the flag is stamped
    //     automatically at intake on any OPEN lead that merely re-uses a
    //     contact's email, so an ordinary duplicate makes that CONTACT
    //     undeletable — and because `crm_contact.crm_account` is a
    //     master-detail with `deleteBehavior: 'cascade'`, the ACCOUNT above it
    //     too. A GDPR "delete this person" request with no way to carry it out.
    //
    //     The rule restored here is one line: **the discriminator may not
    //     outlive the lookup it names.** When a write leaves that lookup blank,
    //     the claim is retired WHOLE — type and status go with the link — and
    //     the lead simply stops saying it duplicates something.
    //
    //     ⚠️ This is deliberately NOT a second spelling of #720's "is this write
    //     the engine's reference cleanup?" predicate in `lead_automation` above.
    //     Re-measured on 17.1.0 with a probe hook at priority 199: the engine's
    //     cleanup write and a user's hand-clear of the same lookup are identical
    //     in everything this block could read — identical `input`
    //     (`{ id, <link>: null, updated_at, updated_by }`), identical
    //     `ctx.user`, identical `ctx.session` — because the engine builds the
    //     cleanup on the CALLER's own context. They are not indistinguishable
    //     outright, though: a marker is reachable at
    //     `ctx.api.executionContext.__referentialFieldClear`, `true` on the
    //     cascade and `undefined` on the hand-clear. The #1165 ruling of
    //     2026-08-25 upheld NOT reading it — an operation-private key is an
    //     undeclared dependency, and a hook body in QuickJS can be handed an
    //     api shim with no `executionContext` at all (#1412; the declared
    //     replacement is asked for as objectstack-ai/objectstack#13644).
    //     None of which changes this block, and that is the point: asking "is
    //     the pair still whole?" needs no provenance at all, and answers both
    //     callers the same correct way — a lead whose link you removed no
    //     longer duplicates anything, however the removal was spelled.
    //
    //     It does NOT loosen the pairing, which is the thing to check when
    //     reading this: a write that STATES a type without naming a record is
    //     still refused by `requiredWhen`, on insert and on update. That is what
    //     the `restated` guard below protects — a payload carrying its own
    //     non-blank `duplicate_of_type` is an author's claim, so it is left for
    //     the rule to judge instead of being quietly deleted.
    //
    //     ⚠️ Priority 300 is load-bearing here, not just for job 2:
    //     `lead_automation` (200) must see the CALLER's payload before these two
    //     nulls are added to it. Its reference-cleanup yield passes a write only
    //     when every non-system change is a declared LOOKUP going value→null,
    //     and `duplicate_of_type` / `duplicate_status` are neither — so at a
    //     lower priority this block would make the converted-lead lock refuse
    //     the very cleanup that yield exists to allow.
    // D3 stand-down on the predicate path — the `email` / `company_normalized`
    // normalisation above reads only the payload, so it is batch-scoped by
    // construction and keeps running. This block is not: see `forecast.hook.ts`.

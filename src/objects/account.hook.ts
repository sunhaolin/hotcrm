      // ─── Territory (#621 storage location, #639 classification) ────────
      //
      // Two derived columns, one input. `billing_country` is the flat
      // projection of `billing_address.country`; `territory` is the CLASSIFIED
      // value the two territory sharing rules now filter on. This block is the
      // only writer of both.
      //
      // `billing_country` became a flat column because a sharing rule's CEL
      // condition is compiled into a pushdown-able query filter, and that
      // compiler rejects any path reaching INSIDE a composite `address` value
      // — `record.billing_address.country in [...]` is not translatable, so
      // plugin-sharing dropped both rules on every boot and `na_sales_team` /
      // `eu_sales_team` got nothing at all (#621).
      //
      // That fixed WHERE the country is read from and left WHAT the rules
      // match on unfixed: a free-text country. `United States` matched no
      // territory, silently, and the same country lists were restated in two
      // CEL strings and six documentation files. #639 replaced the matching
      // with `territory`, a declared select — see `./_territory.ts` for the
      // whole argument and for the authored tables this table is derived from.
      //
      // ── Two different recompute rules, on purpose ──
      //
      // `billing_country` MIRRORS the address, so it is rewritten only when
      // the write carries one: a partial update that never mentions
      // `billing_address` must leave it alone, or every unrelated edit would
      // blank the column. A write that CLEARS the address
      // (`billing_address: null`) does clear it — the key is present, the
      // value is empty.
      //
      // `territory` is a CLASSIFICATION, and #639 decided it is always a
      // stated fact rather than a blank ("belongs to no territory" and "nobody
      // filled it in" must not look alike). So it is also stated on an insert
      // that carries no address at all, where it is `other`. On an update that
      // does not mention the address it is left alone, exactly like the
      // projection — an unrelated edit must not re-derive it.
      //
      // Only `country` is read. `countryCode` is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 slot
      // and would be the better input, but it is optional and mostly empty in
      // this app's data; reading it in preference would move which slot decides
      // an account's territory, which #639 did not ask for. `UK` vs `GB` is
      // handled in the mapping instead (both are `emea`), which is why nothing
      // had to migrate.
      //
      // ── Why the map is INLINE rather than imported ──
      //
      // A hook handler is lowered to a metadata-only `body.source` and
      // evaluated inside QuickJS with no module scope, so an import is a
      // `ReferenceError` at runtime, not a closure; `extractHookBody` rejects
      // such a handler and `test/action-sandbox.test.ts` runs that same
      // lowering pass over every registered hook. The table therefore cannot be
      // read from `./_territory.ts` here. It is not trusted to stay in step
      // either: `test/territory-single-source.test.ts` parses this literal out
      // of the LOWERED body and asserts deep equality with the module's derived
      // map, so a country added to either side alone fails.

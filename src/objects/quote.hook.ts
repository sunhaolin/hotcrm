     *     with nothing behind it;
     *   - `contract_type` — the contract declares six values (subscription /
     *     service / license / partnership / nda / msa) and NO option default,
     *     so this line is the only thing that ever picks one: every
     *     auto-drafted contract in the app is a subscription and the other
     *     five types are unreachable on this path. It does not stay here
     *     either — `src/flows/billing-handoff.flow.ts` POSTs `contract_type`
     *     to billing when the contract activates;
     *   - `start_date` — the one member that is not a literal: the date the
     *     quote happened to be ACCEPTED, which is not necessarily the date the
     *     customer's term begins. A placeholder RULE rather than a placeholder
     *     value. It sits in the block because the block is itself per-draft:
     *     an L2 body has no module scope at runtime (see the file header), so
     *     these are handler-local by construction, not module constants.
     *
     * `end_date` is not a fourth default — it is DERIVED from the two above
     * (`addMonths`, real calendar months), so it inherits their guesses rather
     * than adding one of its own.
     *
     * ⛔ Do not read these as decisions and do not quietly re-tune them. The
     * alternative — the quote carrying a real term and type so the draft
     * transcribes what was sold — is option A of #1129: recorded, not
     * undertaken, unfrozen only by measured evidence that real sales processes
     * fix the term and type at acceptance time. This block is then the list of
     * values that move onto `crm_quote`. Leaving them unmarked was excluded by

/**
 * Case SLA & escalation hook.
 *
 * - Stamps `sla_due_date` on a case that has none, from the priority × account
 *   tier matrix in `_case-sla.ts` (⚠️ CALENDAR hours — this app has no
 *   business-hours calendar and the deadline does not skip nights, weekends or
 *   holidays).
 * - On escalation: creates a follow-up task OWNED BY the account owner (the
 *   single owner of escalation tasks — flows must not create their own).
 *   Owning it, not merely labelling it: `owner_id` is the one ownership column,
 *   so the person the task names is the person who can work it.
 * - On `resolved`: bumps account `last_activity_date`.
 *
 * ⚠️ Ownership assignment is NOT here: all three answers to "who should own
 * this case" live in `_case-assignment.ts` — the ownerless-intake round-robin,
 * the escalation hand-off to the `service_manager` pool, and the triage
 * self-claim. One module, so the app never grows two independently-authored
 * ownership paths on `crm_case`; its hooks are composed into this module's
 * default export below, so the registry still sees one `crm_case` hook set. In
 * particular the escalation hand-off is deliberately NOT a branch of
 * `case_status_side_effects` below: that hook writes through `ctx.api`, a seam
 * the #3004 transfer guard CAN see (which would demand
 * `crm_case.allowTransfer`) and a second write that re-enters the record-change
 * trigger surface. Both measurements are in `_case-assignment.ts`'s header.

    //
    // ✅ HISTORY, RESOLVED — and the conclusion is unchanged. Through 17.2.0,
    // `delete ctx.input.<field>` in a hook was a SILENT NO-OP: ObjectQL hands a
    // hook `ctx.input` as `{ data, options }` behind a flat-record Proxy
    // (`installFlatInput`, `@objectstack/objectql` `src/hook-wrappers.ts`) that
    // trapped `get` / `set` / `has` / `ownKeys` / `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` and
    // routed each into `data` — but declared no `deleteProperty` trap, so the
    // delete fell through to the WRAPPER, one level above the record:
    //
    //   delete input.owner_id   -> returned TRUE  (JS reported success)
    //   'owner_id' in input     -> still true
    //   input.owner_id          -> still the caller's value
    //
    // Fifteen such statements across two intake hooks did nothing in production
    // while their tests passed (#1133). This block was rewritten to ASSIGN.
    //
    // The block above predicted its own trigger — "a platform release that
    // POSTDATES 2026-08-26" — and that release is **17.3.0** (`package.json`
    // has pinned 17.4.0 since PR #1814, #1807, so the fix is in the installed
    // tree either way). objectstack#12277 shipped: the in-process Proxy
    // traps `deleteProperty`, and the sandbox path diffs deletions against the
    // entry snapshot rather than writing mutations home with `Object.assign`,
    // which cannot represent a removal. Re-measured through the engine's own
    // `wrapDeclarativeHook` in `test/hook-input-shape.test.ts`, which now pins
    // the new contract in both directions.
    //
    // ⛔ The trap arriving is NOT a licence to spell this block with `delete`.
    // What these lines WRITE is load-bearing independently of how it is spelled:
    // `case_auto_assign` stands down only on a non-empty STRING `owner_id`, so
    // the column must arrive `null` rather than ABSENT (see the `null` note
    // below). Removing a key and writing `null` are different downstream, so
    // switching to `delete` would be a behaviour change on the public-form
    // boundary, not a re-spelling. Assign — for the reason, not the constraint.
    //
    // ⚠️ `null` rather than `''` or `undefined`, all three measured on the
    // write path: `null` stores as null, `''` stores as an empty string (wrong
    // in a lookup — see `case_resolution_article_normalize` below), and
    // `undefined` stores the KEY with an undefined value rather than omitting
    // it, which is not the same as absent and is what a `has()`-guarded CEL
    // predicate then trips over. `null` is also what the downstream owner
    // writer reads as "ownerless": `case_auto_assign` stands down only on a
    // non-empty STRING `owner_id`, so a nulled column still reaches the
    // round-robin.
    //
    // ⚠️ `!ctx.session?.isSystem` is load-bearing. A predicate of
    // `!ctx.previous && !ctx.user?.id` conflates the two callers that both
    // arrive without a user id: an anonymous web-to-case submitter (untrusted,
    // the caller this branch exists for) and a SYSTEM write — seed load,
    // backfill, demo bootstrap, migration — the most trusted caller there is.
    // Elsewhere in this app that same absence is read the opposite way:
    // `lead_automation`'s converted-lead lock treats `!ctx.user?.id` as "system
    // write, allow it". Without the narrowing, a system insert that names an
    // owner has that owner blanked and every seeded or backfilled case lands
    // ownerless (eight cases in `test/unassigned-case-triage-reach.test.ts`
    // insert owned cases exactly that way). `ctx.session.isSystem` is the
    // discriminator: a system context arrives as `session: { isSystem: true }`
    // and an anonymous one carries no session at all. Narrowing only ever
    // REMOVES callers from the branch, so nothing sanitised today stops being.
    //
    // `escalation_reason` is stripped ALONGSIDE `is_escalated`, and the pair is
    // why: cleaning only the FLAG leaves the prose that explains the flag
    // writable, so a case could carry a stated escalation reason while
    // `is_escalated` is false — a contradiction on the record page's own
    // `escalation` field group, where a service agent reads both. It IS a
    // widening of a security control, so it is argued rather than assumed:
    // `escalation_reason` is pipeline, not a fact a submitter states about
    // themselves — the rule this branch declares — and every real writer is
    // staff-side (`case_escalation`, `case_sla_monitor`, the `escalate_case`
    // screen flow). The public `web_to_case` form (`src/views/case.view.ts`)
    // collects exactly `subject`, `description`, `type` and `priority`, so
    // nulling this drops nothing any guest surface asks for. `guest_portal`
    // grants `crm_case.allowCreate` at the OBJECT level with no field
    // allow-list, which is precisely why this branch is the field-level control
    // and why an omission from it is a hole rather than a second layer.
    //
    // ⚠️ The middleware path is MEASURED, and the answer bounds what this
    // branch may claim. A real anonymous write does NOT reach these columns on
    // the shipped app today — and this branch is not what stops it. Driven
    // against a real server (`objectstack start`, the production plugin set:
    // Auth, Security, Sharing, RestAPI), unauthenticated over HTTP:
    //
    //   POST  /api/v1/data/crm_case         401 UNAUTHENTICATED
    //   PATCH /api/v1/data/crm_case/:id     401 UNAUTHENTICATED
    //   POST  /api/v1/actions/...           401 UNAUTHENTICATED
    //   POST  /api/v1/mcp                   401 UNAUTHENTICATED
    //   POST  /api/v1/forms/support/submit  201 — the ONE anonymous write path
    //
    // and that surviving route filters the body against an allow-list built
    // from the matched form view's OWN declared sections (`@objectstack/rest`,
    // `registerFormEndpoints`), so a planted internal field is dropped before
    // ObjectQL and before this hook.
    // ⛔ So do NOT write down that a guest reaches these columns in production.
    //
    // ⛔ And do not read that as "this branch is cosmetic". That allow-list is
    // the form's FIELD LIST — a product decision, not a security declaration —
    // and #1505 measured it by widening it: ONE line added to `web_to_case`'s
    // sections and the same anonymous POST stored the planted value, while a
    // field left off the widened form stayed null in the same request. That is
    // what identifies the form list as the only thing holding, and this branch
    // as the layer that has to hold when it moves. ⚠️ That measurement was
    // taken on `customer_rating` / `customer_feedback`, which #1428 has since
    // retired under ADR-0049 — the two columns are gone, so the branch no
    // longer strips them; the mechanism the measurement established is
    // unchanged and governs every field it still assigns.
    //
    // ⚠️ Field-level permissions are not a second layer behind this branch, and
    // that was re-measured against the installed tree rather than taken on
    // report: `PermissionEvaluator.getFieldPermissions` builds its mask ONLY
    // from `<object>.<field>` keys a permission set names in its `fields` map,
    // and `FieldMasker.detectForbiddenWrites` returns early on an empty mask
    // and otherwise flags only names present in it. `guest_portal` declares no
    // `fields` key at all, so its mask is empty and the write guard is skipped
    // outright — a field NO profile names is unrestricted, not restricted.
    //
    // Nulling `escalation_reason` cannot trip the object's
    // `escalation_reason_required` validation: that rule fires only on
    // `is_escalated == true`, this same branch forces `is_escalated = false`,

/**
 * Normalise a BLANK `resolved_by_article` to NULL.
 *
 * Additive and deliberately independent of everything above: it touches no

 *
 * ### Why it has to exist
 *
 * `resolved_by_article` is the column the deflection ratio on `case_metrics`
 * counts (`kb_resolved_count` = `count(resolved_by_article)` over closed cases).
 *
 * ⚠️ Platform behaviour, measured against the real automation engine: an
 * optional SCREEN field the agent leaves empty does not arrive as "absent" —
 * the resume carries `''`, and `update_record` writes that empty string into
 * the column:
 *
 *   supplied `'ka1'` → `resolved_by_article: "ka1"`
 *   left blank       → `resolved_by_article: ""`      ← counted by count(col)
 *   key omitted      → column not written at all      ← correct
 *
 * SQL `count(column)` counts every NON-NULL value, and `''` is not NULL. So
 * without this hook every case closed WITHOUT an article lands in the numerator
 * and the deflection rate reads 100% on a dashboard that raises no error while
 * doing it — a wrong ratio indistinguishable from a right one.
 *
 * Fixing it here rather than in the measure is deliberate: an empty string in a
 * lookup column is wrong for the record form, the list views, the reports and
 * any future reader too, so it is the STORED value that is corrected. Teaching
 * one measure to discount `''` is a lenient consumer papering over bad data,
 * and the next reader would not know to copy it.
 * `test/knowledge-deflection.test.ts` pins both halves.
 *
 * ⚠️ The blank test is spelled inline rather than lifted into a shared helper:
 * hook handlers lower to a metadata-only body and a free identifier would push
 * this one into the legacy runtime bundle instead
 * (`test/action-sandbox.test.ts` fails the build on it).

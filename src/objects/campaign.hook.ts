/**
 * Campaign lifecycle hooks.
 *
 * - `campaign_validation` — start/end date ordering, and no `in_progress`
 *   without both dates.
 * - `campaign_metrics_refresh` — recompute the metric block when the campaign's
 *   own status moves.
 * - `campaign_attribution_refresh` — recompute it when an opportunity's campaign
 *   attribution changes.
 * - `campaign_lead_conversion_refresh` — promote the member rows of a
 *   converting lead, then recompute.
 *
 * The membership side of the same recompute lives in `campaign_member.hook.ts`.
 * Together these are what replaced the single completion-time snapshot (#597):
 * every input a campaign metric derives from now has a trigger that refreshes
 * the metric when it changes, so a LIVE campaign reports live numbers instead
 * of zeros until the day it ends.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THE RECOMPUTE IS WRITTEN OUT FOUR TIMES.
 *
 * L2 hook bodies are lowered to metadata and evaluated BODY-ONLY in the QuickJS
 * sandbox: a handler cannot reach module scope at runtime, so a shared
 * `refreshCampaignMetrics()` import would be a free identifier — the CLI build
 * silently declines to lower the handler, keeps it in a bundled runtime file,
 * and the hook stops being deployable as pure metadata (the build says so in
 * one line nobody reads). `test/action-sandbox.test.ts` is what catches it.
 *
 * So the arithmetic is inlined per handler, the same way `account_protection`
 * inlines the territory table rather than importing `_territory.ts`. The
 * duplication is NOT trusted: `test/campaign-member-lifecycle.test.ts` lowers
 * all four bodies and asserts the recompute block is character-identical across
 * them, so a fix landing on one copy and skipping three fails a test instead of
 * shipping four definitions of `num_sent`.

/**
 * Recompute this campaign's metrics when its own status moves.
 *
 * ⚠️ RECURSION. This hook writes to the object it listens on, so its trigger
 * has to be a condition its own write cannot satisfy. It is: the write carries
 * the metric block and nothing else, and this fires only on a `status`
 * TRANSITION — `input.status` present AND different from `previous.status`. A
 * metric-only write has no `status` key at all, so the re-entry ends at the
 * first guard. `CAMPAIGN_METRIC_WRITE_KEYS` at the bottom of this file states
 * the other half of that contract as data the runtime test checks the recorded
 * write against, so a future writer that adds a non-metric key to the refresh
 * write fails a test instead of looping in production.
 *
 * The old `campaign_snapshot_metrics` fired on `→ completed` and nothing else,
 * which meant a campaign reported zeros for its entire useful life and became
 * accurate on the day everybody stopped looking at it. Completion is now simply
 * one of the transitions this catches.

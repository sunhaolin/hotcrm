 * Opportunity lifecycle hook.
 *
 * - Re-derives `expected_revenue` from `amount * stageProbability` when either changes.
 * - Stamps `stage_entry_date` on insert and on every stage change — the stored
 *   clock behind the `days_in_stage` formula and the stagnation sweep (#489).
 * - Freezes most fields after stage is closed (won/lost) — only narrative fields
 *   editable. The freeze yields to the engine's reference cleanup, so a closed
 *   deal never makes the records it points at undeletable (#720).
 * - On `closed_won`: stamps `close_date=today`, promotes the parent account to `customer`,
 *   and asynchronously schedules an "Activate customer" task.

    //   • this freeze guard keys on `ctx.user?.id`, which is PRESENT ⇒ the

 * `do_not_call` — refuse to SCHEDULE a phone touch, never to record one.
 *
 * # Why this is a hook and not an action predicate
 *
 * The obvious mirror of the `email_opt_out` treatment is
 * `visible: P\`record.do_not_call == false\`` on a button, the way
 * `send_email` and `add_contact_to_campaign` are gated in
 * `src/actions/contact.actions.ts`. That is a RENDERING hint, and it is the
 * whole of what those two do: it hides a button in the Console and leaves the
 * action reachable over REST, from an AI tool call, from a flow, and from an
 * import. For email that is only half a promise too — but the email half is
 * backed by real enforcement elsewhere (`campaign-enrollment.flow.ts` filters
 * on the flag, `campaign_member.hook.ts` writes it). `do_not_call` had no such
 * backing, so a predicate alone would have moved the field from "declared and
 * unenforced" to "declared and unenforced unless you use the mouse".
 *
 * Enforcing on the WRITE instead covers every entry point at once — the
 * `schedule_followup` screen flow, a hand-created task, an import, an AI agent
 * calling the data API — which is the same "one writer, not one per entry
 * point" reasoning `src/actions/global.actions.ts` gives for keeping the
 * recency bubble on `crm_event`'s hook rather than in each button's body.
 *
 * # Why `type: 'call'` and not "any forward-looking outreach"
 *
 * `do_not_call` is a promise about the PHONE. It is not `do_not_contact`:
 * this person may still be emailed (that is `email_opt_out`'s separate flag),
 * met, or demoed to. Refusing a `meeting` task here would silently widen a
 * declared field into a promise the app never made — the mirror image of the
 * defect this guard closes.
 *
 * # Why a completed task is allowed through
 *
 * A `completed` Call task is a RECORD of a call that already happened, not a
 * plan to place one. Refusing it would delete the evidence rather than prevent
 * the call — and would make the flag actively harmful, because the honest rep
 * who logs the call they should not have made is the one who gets blocked. The
 * same reasoning keeps the `log_call` action reachable and ungated.

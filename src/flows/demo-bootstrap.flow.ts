/**
 * Demo-org bootstrap — bind the seeded demo data to the first real user.
 *
 * A seed cannot name a user. Lookup values resolve against the target's
 * externalId and that only works for objects in the app's own graph, so
 * `owner_id: 'Dev Admin'` would store the literal string rather than an id
 * (verified against 16.1.0). A hook on `sys_user` is rejected at build time —
 * cross-reference validation refuses hooks on objects the app doesn't
 * declare. The user id only exists after first boot, so this has to be a
 * scheduled sweep.
 *
 * Without it a freshly seeded org comes up with every record ownerless, and
 * that quietly disables a tier of the product: "My Leads" / "My Deals" /
 * "My Cases" are empty for everyone, and any `notify` addressed to a record's
 * owner reaches nobody.
 *
 * Idempotent: once a record has an owner the query no longer returns it and
 * each pass is a no-op. `runAs: 'system'` because a scheduled run has no
 * trigger user and these writes must bypass RLS (ADR-0049).
 *
 * Per-record updates inside a loop, not one filtered mass update: the
 * `update_record` node calls `data.update(...)` without `options.multi`, so a
 * filter matching more than one row fails with "Update requires an ID or
 * options.multi=true". Same shape as `case_sla_monitor`.
 *
 * Scoped to a demo install by intent — it claims records for whoever the first
 * user is. A real deployment assigns ownership through import or territory
 * rules instead, and by then nothing is ownerless for this to pick up.
 *
 * ─── ⛔ This flow must NOT staff anybody ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⛔ Never add a `create_record` on `sys_user`, or on any identity table, to
 * this flow. It ships in the ARTIFACT, so it runs in a customer's org too, and
 * the only way to make synthetic users there impossible rather than unlikely is
 * for the artifact to contain no mechanism that can create one.
 * `test/demo-staffing.test.ts` fails on any flow node that writes an identity
 * table. Such a node would not produce usable people anyway: identity tables are
 * `managedBy: 'better-auth'` (ADR-0092), and a row inserted around that surface
 * has no credential — an account nobody can sign in as.
 *
 * Staffing lives in `pnpm demo:staff`, which drives a LOCAL dev server through
 * the platform's own admin endpoints. It depends on this flow's behaviour
 * staying exactly as it is: the demo's whole point is that a rep reads accounts
 * they do NOT own (a `private` OWD already admits the owner, so a share to the
 * owner proves nothing). The reps are created after the dev admin and appended
 * to `sys_user`, so `get_user`'s unordered "first user" is unaffected by
 * staffing — and the staffing script re-checks that from the other side,
 * failing if any demo user turns out to own a seeded account.
 *
 * ─── ONE ownership column ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `owner_id` is the ONLY owner this app has. It is the column ObjectQL injects
 * into every user-owned object, and the only one the sharing service reads:
 * under `sharingModel: 'private'` the OWD baseline admits the owner of
 * `owner_id` and a share can only WIDEN from there. It also drives the "My …"
 * views, the owner-addressed `notify` in every sweep, and the owner axis of the
 * analytics datasets.
 *
 * ⛔ Never author a second, app-level owner lookup beside it. A row claimed on
 * such a column comes out of a sweep looking claimed everywhere a human would
 * check, while still being owned by nobody as far as access control is
 * concerned: `PATCH` answers 403 for EVERY user including the admin, and the
 * attachment surface, which gates on `canEdit(parent)`, answers 403
 * `ATTACHMENT_PARENT_ACCESS` on upload. A sweep whose filter then reads the
 * second column never looks at the row again, so the state is terminal. With one
 * column that failure mode is structurally gone rather than guarded against —
 * there is no second column left to disagree with the first.
 *
 * Why rows reach the platform ownerless at all, and the reason this flow exists:
 * seed writes run under `{ isSystem: true }`, which short-circuits the security
 * middleware entirely, so the insert-time auto-stamp of `owner_id` never fires
 * ("seeds either declare those fields explicitly per record"). HotCRM's seeds
 * cannot declare it — no seed can name a user. So ownership at the platform
 * level is THIS flow's job, and nothing else's.
 *
 * One pass per object, selecting `{ owner_id: null }`. On a healthy org it
 * selects nothing.

/**
 * The objects whose seeded rows this flow claims.
 *
 * MEMBERSHIP RULE, computed rather than curated: an object belongs here when it
 * is seeded AND declares `owner_id`. `test/flow-scheduled.test.ts` crosses the
 * registered objects three ways — seeded × declares `owner_id` × claimed here —
 * and fails while the "seeded and owner-scoped but unclaimed" cell is non-empty,
 * so the next seeded owner-scoped object cannot be forgotten. ⛔ Do not
 * hand-maintain this list against a written roster instead.
 *
 * An object declaring NO `owner_id` stays OUT — `crm_product` (a shared
 * catalogue) and `crm_event_attendee` (`sharingModel: 'controlled_by_parent'`,
 * its access derived from the event it hangs off). There is no ownership to
 * claim and stamping one would write a column the object does not have; the
 * same test asserts that direction too.
 *
 * ⚠️ OWD does not decide membership, and reading it as if it did is what hides
 * an omission. On a `private` (or `controlled_by_parent`) object an ownerless
 * row is INVISIBLE and the defect announces itself on the first list view. On a
 * `public_read` object the seeded rows read fine for everybody and look
 * perfectly healthy — but `public_read` opens the READ baseline only:
 * "public_read is read-open but write-owned; only a fully public object is
 * write-open" (`@objectstack/plugin-sharing` 17.0.0-rc.2, `buildWriteFilter`).
 * A write still needs owner-match, or a share at a write level.
 *
 * Which turns a GRANTED permission into a permanent 403. `marketing_user` holds
 * `crm_campaign` at `allowEdit: true, modifyAllRecords: false`, and
 * `service_agent` holds `crm_knowledge_article` the same way. With
 * `modifyAllRecords: false` and no `writeScope` the effective write depth is
 * `own`, whose filter is `owner_id == caller` — a predicate no null-owner row
 * can satisfy. So the permission table says "can edit" while every seeded row
 * answers 403 for everyone but `system_admin`. ⛔ Criteria shares are not a
 * substitute: `campaign_leadership_*` (`src/sharing/campaign.sharing.ts`) widens
 * edit to two marketing POSITIONS and only while a campaign is
 * `planning`/`in_progress`, so it covers neither the finished seeded campaigns
 * nor any knowledge article, and nobody holding the plain `marketing_user` grant
 * is reached by it at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ Before adding an object, check for a SECOND PRODUCER of the same row. A
 * claim is correct only while nothing else writes rows in the window this sweep
 * would stamp. `crm_forecast` is claimable because the seeds ship no row in the
 * window `forecast_snapshot` owns (`src/data/revenue.seed.ts`); while they did,
 * stamping an owner here would have moved the phantom onto the first user rather
 * than removing it, and left a permanent duplicate on any boot where the 03:00
 * sweep reached the window first. `crm_event` has no such overlap: `log_call` /
 * `log_meeting` / `schedule_meeting` insert their row with an explicit
 * `owner_id` (an action body runs `isSystem`, so it stamps ownership itself —
 * `src/actions/global.actions.ts`), so a rep's own interactions are never
 * ownerless and this sweep never selects them.
 *
 * Who owns a seeded knowledge article, recorded rather than decided (PM ruling):
 * the first user, by the same demo convention every other object here follows.
 * Whether a real deployment's article owner means its AUTHOR or its MAINTAINER
 * is a product question this claim deliberately does not prejudge — a real
 * deployment assigns ownership before this sweep has anything to pick up.

 * New-contact alert — record-change flow on contact insert.

 * a raw email address is stored verbatim as an inbox `user_id` and reaches
 * nobody. A true outbound welcome email to the contact needs an email connector
 * action, not an inbox notification.
 *
 * Gated on `email_opt_out != true` so an opted-out contact triggers no outreach
 * prompt, and skipped entirely when there is no owner to notify.

  // Measured honestly on 17.0.0-rc.2: this flow has NO data node today (start

  // and `notify` dispatches through the messaging service without a run data
  // context — so a user-less run completes and delivers today, and this
  // declaration changes nothing observable right now. It is declared anyway
  // because the decision being recorded is "record-change automation runs as
  // the platform", not "this flow currently happens to have no data node".
  // The day a data node is added — or a start-node `config.expand`, which is
  // the remedy the notify node's own error message recommends and which reads
  // through the same guarded path — the elevation has already been reasoned
  // about here rather than discovered as a refusal in production. Elevation is
  // harmless for the user-driven runs: there is no data operation to scope.

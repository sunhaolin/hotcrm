  // Measured honestly on 17.0.0-rc.2: this flow has NO data node (start →
  // notify → end), so the refusal does not reach it today and declaring

  // `contact_welcome` — see the fuller note there: the recorded decision is
  // that record-change automation runs as the platform, so a data node added
  // later inherits an elevation that was reasoned about rather than one
  // discovered as a production refusal. No data operation exists to scope, so
  // elevating the user-driven runs costs nothing.

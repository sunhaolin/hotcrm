      // the one shape this exhibit must not demonstrate.
      //
      // ## Why the refusal is HERE and not on `convert_lead`'s predicate
      //
      // A refusal must NAME the verdict and the surviving record, and measured
      // against `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0 the action predicates cannot:
      // `visible` and `disabled` are each a bare boolean/CEL envelope with
      // nowhere to put a sentence, so `visible` hides a button that cannot then
      // explain itself and `disabled` greys one out with no reason attached.
      // `errorMessage` on the Action is a single static string — what the
      // console toasts on a FAILED run — and cannot say anything about THIS
      // lead. A screen node's `description` is interpolated per run and
      // rendered by `FlowRunner` as the dialog body.
      //
      // The flow is also the only choke point covering every door: the
      // record-header button, the list-row button and the `action_convert_lead`
      // AI tool all dispatch `POST /automation/lead_conversion/trigger`, while
      // `visible` / `disabled` are console-side and say nothing to the other
      // two.
      //
      // ## What the rep sees, measured on the shipped console bundle
      //
      // A run that PAUSES returns `{ success: true, silent: true }` to the
      // action framework (`RecordDetailView`'s flow handler), and `silent`
      // suppresses the success toast — so `convert_lead`'s
      // `successMessage: 'Lead converted successfully!'` does NOT fire behind
      // this dialog. Submitting it resumes into `end`; nothing is created and
      // the lead is untouched on either path, because every write in this flow
      // is downstream of `screen_1`.
      //
      // ## What the copy may claim
      //
      // ⛔ NOT the shared email address, which is what `warn_duplicate` above
      // uses. That claim is safe for `suspected` because only
      // `lead_duplicate_check` writes it and it matches on email; `confirmed`
      // is written by a PERSON, and the lead form lets a reviewer point
      // `duplicate_of_type` + its lookup at any record they like. So the
      // refusal names the survivor through the relationship fields that exist
      // to carry it (`test/record-id-not-in-prose.test.ts`: "the id goes in the
      // relationship field that exists to carry it, or nowhere"), naming the
      // `duplicates` field group by its zh-CN pack label, 「重复线索管理」.
      // That sentence also stays true on the `erased` tombstone, where the
      // verdict survives its pointer (`lead.hook.ts`, job 1c).
      //
      // ⛔ Never transcribe the vocabulary of `duplicate_of_type` into this
      // sentence ("an existing Lead" / "an existing Contact"). Those labels are
      // locale-pack facts with one source of truth, the rep can see them on the
      // section this line points at, and a hand-copied machine list in prose is
      // the drift AGENTS.md documentation rule 5 forbids.
      //
      // Flow copy is Chinese on this demo branch — see `warn_duplicate` above
      // for why a locale-pack entry would not reach this dialog.

 *
 * ⛔ Never re-express these as `body`-typed actions (verified against the
 * running 16.1.0 console, 2026-07-28):
 *
 *  - `type: 'modal'` never executes the body at all — on submit the console
 *    resolves the action `target` as an OBJECT name and dies on
 *    `GET /api/v1/meta/object/<target>` → 400 ("Error loading form").
 *  - `type: 'script'` DOES reach `POST /api/v1/actions/...`, but a body that
 *    UPDATES a record on an object with sharing rules is rejected by the
 *    sharing middleware ("FORBIDDEN: insufficient privileges to update
 *    crm_case …") — the sandbox execution context does not carry the caller
 *    identity, so `canEdit` fails even for the record owner. Inserts are
 *    unaffected (clone_opportunity works), updates are not.
 *  - Screen flows execute through the automation service, whose
 *    `update_record` nodes demonstrably write `crm_case` (the
 *    case_escalation record-change flow does exactly that in production).
 *
 * Same mechanism as `schedule_followup` / `lead_conversion`.

/**
 * Claim Case — the triage claim gesture, given a button.
 *
 * ## What this flow is, and what it deliberately is NOT
 *
 * The claim already exists as behaviour: an agent moves an unowned case out of
 * **Unassigned — triage** by setting its status to one that means a person is
 * on it, and `case_self_claim` (`src/objects/_case-assignment.ts`, priority
 * 260) stamps `owner_id` with the caller. This flow is the screen that says so.
 *
 * It is **pure UI over the existing seam**. Its one write is the
 * STATUS MOVE. It does not write `owner_id`, and that is not a style choice:
 *
 *  - the ownership-transfer gate refuses any payload carrying `owner_id` in the
 *    sharing MIDDLEWARE, upstream of the hook phase, and a screen flow's
 *    `update_record` runs as the caller — so a flow that wrote the column would
 *    be refused exactly like a hand-written update, loudly and always;
 *  - and `case_self_claim` guard 2 stands down the moment `owner_id` is already
 *    in the payload, so even a caller holding `allowTransfer` would take the
 *    claim seam out of the picture rather than drive it.
 *
 * Ownership therefore keeps exactly ONE writer. `test/claim-case-one-owner-writer.test.ts`
 * is that sentence turned into a guard, so it is enforced rather than intended.
 *
 * ## Why `runAs: 'user'`, spelled out rather than defaulted
 *
 * House rule 9 (`AGENTS.md`) already says a screen flow stays `runAs: 'user'`,
 * but here the default is LOAD-BEARING and worth reading twice: `case_self_claim`
 * returns early for a write with no user, and again for `ctx.session.isSystem`.
 * An elevated run of this flow would move the status and claim NOTHING — the
 * case would leave the triage tab still ownerless. The declaration is explicit
 * so the next author sees the coupling before reaching for elevation.
 *
 * ## Why a screen, and why the picker is derived
 *
 * The three statuses that claim are one concept with three faces, and which one
 * an agent picks is real information (`waiting_customer` straight off a triage
 * row is a different day's work from `in_progress`). The options are built from
 * {@link CLAIMABLE_TARGET_STATUSES} — the seam's own declared set — rather than
 * hand-copied. ⛔ Never hand-copy the subset: it silently drops an option from
 * the picker and nothing notices. A fourth claimable status the zh-CN pack does
 * not label makes this module throw at load rather than show a raw value.
 */

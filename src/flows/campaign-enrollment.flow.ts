/**
 * Campaign Enrollment — screen flow to bulk-enroll leads OR contacts into a
 * campaign.
 *
 * Launched from the "Enroll Members" action on a campaign record. ⛔ Never turn
 * this into a `schedule` flow: a cron firing seeds NO input variables — only the
 * console's flow-action trigger does (cf. lead_conversion) — so `recordId` and
 * the segment fields arrive undefined, and the run either matches no campaign or
 * mass-enrolls every open lead into a null campaign.
 *
 * The contact branch mirrors the lead branch rather than being a second dialect:
 * same open-campaign gate, same eligibility shape, same per-member dedupe, same
 * `sent` + `added_date` stamp. Segmentation mirrors too — leads are segmented by
 * `status` (where they are in qualification); contacts have no such column, so
 * they are segmented by `department`, the field that answers "who is this person
 * at the account", which is what a campaign targeting an existing customer base
 * selects on.
 *
 * Eligibility, both sides: has an email, and is not opted out of email; leads
 * additionally must not already be converted (a converted lead is now a contact,
 * and would otherwise be enrollable through both branches as two people).
 * Already-enrolled people are skipped, so re-running the action tops up rather
 * than duplicating.
 *
 * ⛔ This flow does NOT write the campaign metric rollups (`num_sent` etc.) —
 * the campaign metric hooks own them and refresh on every membership change. A
 * per-run `num_sent = {leadList.length}` overwrite here clobbers prior batches.

     * `memberSource` is BOUND BY THIS DECLARATION — not by a seeding node.
     *
     * Both branch edges (`e4` / `e7`) read `vars.memberSource`, so it must be
     * bound on every path reaching them. `FlowVariableSchema` carries
     * `defaultValue` and the engine seeds it before the start node runs, so this
     * key alone binds the name — while a caller-supplied
     * `context.params.memberSource` still WINS over it.
     *
     * ⚠️ Measured on the 17.1.0 spec, with the schema key re-checked on 17.2.0.
     * Neither that key nor the seeding behaviour has been re-checked against the
     * current pin, 17.4.0 since PR #1814 (#1807) — nor was either re-checked on
     * the 17.3.0 pin that preceded it.
     *
     * ⛔ Never seed this with an assignment node instead. An assignment is
     * unconditional, so it CLOBBERS a supplied param — measured: launching with
     * `params.memberSource = 'contacts'` ran the LEAD branch. It also restates a
     * default the screen field carries, with nothing keeping the two in step.
     *
     * A second, independent reason no seeding node is needed here: the
     * `memberSource` screen field below is `required: true`, and since
     * 17.0.0-rc.2 the SERVER holds a screen resume to the declared field
     * contract. A resume signal omitting `memberSource` is refused with
     * `INVALID_SCREEN_INPUT` and the run stays paused, so the ordinary resume
     * path cannot reach an unbound read at all — unlike `lead_conversion`'s
     * checkbox, which is deliberately not `required` and therefore has an
     * unanswered state. The one path that skips that check is a resume carrying
     * NO signal object; measured, it fails one node later at `query_leads`
     * regardless of this binding, because `{leadStatus}` resolves to nothing and
     * `get_record` refuses to run rather than widen the query.
     *
     * The literal lives HERE and nowhere else: the screen field derives its
     * prefill from this variable (`defaultValue: '{memberSource}'`).

     * `filter` — so the binding analysis in

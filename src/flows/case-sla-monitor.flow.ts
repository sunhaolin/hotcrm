/**
 * Case SLA Monitor — scheduled breach detection.
 *
 * Complements `case_escalation` (which reacts to *priority* the moment a case
 * is saved) by adding the missing *time* dimension. The schema carries
 * `sla_due_date` and `is_sla_violated`, but nothing watched the clock — a case
 * could silently blow its SLA. This flow sweeps open (not resolved/closed)
 * cases whose `sla_due_date` has passed, stamps the breach, escalates, and
 * alerts the owner.
 *
 * A breached case with NO owner is the hard case, and it is answered in two
 * halves. The escalation the sweep writes is itself what gives the case an
 * owner — `case_escalation_reassign` rides on that update and hands the case to
 * the least-loaded `service_manager` — so this flow re-reads the case
 * afterwards and alerts whoever it now belongs to. When the pool is empty the
 * assignment is a no-op, the case stays unowned, the alert is skipped at a
 * named gate, and the RUN SURVIVES: the breach is still recorded and every
 * other breached case is still swept. ⛔ No fallback recipient, no
 * manager-chain dot-walk, no hard failure (maintainer ruling 2026-09-03).
 *
 * Capabilities exercised: scheduled trigger + `loop` + `update_record` +
 * `get_record` + `notify`.
 */

/**
 * "The case in hand carries an owner the `notify` node can address."
 *
 * Authored ONCE and used on two edges (`b2` and `b5`) because the two ask the
 * same question at two points in the iteration — before the sweep's write and
 * after it — and a hand-copied second spelling is exactly the drift measured on
 * decision nodes. {@link CASE_HAS_NO_OWNER} is its complement.
 *
 * TOTALITY: `currentCase` is a LOOP ITEM over `caseList`, which
 * `get_record` filled from `data.find` — every element is a raw driver row,
 * sparse in the way a raw driver row is. A case that was never written with
 * an `owner_id` column carries no key at all, so `has()` is the only total
 * accessor; an unguarded `vars.currentCase.owner_id != null` aborts with
 * `No such key` and takes the run down the same way an empty recipient slate
 * once did.
 *
 * Every term is load-bearing, and the last one MIRRORS THE NOTIFY NODE'S OWN
 * emptiness rule rather than guessing at it: builtin `notify` builds its
 * audience with `String(v).trim()` + `.filter(Boolean)`, so null, undefined,
 * `''` AND any all-whitespace value all collapse to the same empty slate.
 * Measured: `'   ' != ""` is TRUE in CEL, so a gate written that way opened for
 * a whitespace `owner_id` and reproduced this very defect one input narrower.
 * `string(...).trim() != ""` is the same predicate the node applies, in CEL.
 *
 * The `string()` wrap is not decoration: bare `.matches()` / `.trim()` on a
 * non-string id fails with `no matching overload`, which is a thrown condition
 * — the fault mode this flow exists to keep out. `string()` is total for every
 * non-null scalar, and the `!= null` term in front short-circuits before it can
 * be handed a null (`string(null)` has no overload either).

 * here, so the two edges partition only the cases where the iterator is bound.
 * That asymmetry is deliberate: with no `currentCase` at all NEITHER edge
 * matches and the iteration simply ends — the pre-existing behaviour — instead
 * of routing an unbindable row into `reload_case`, whose `{currentCase.id}`

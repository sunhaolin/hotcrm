  // either — the user-less exposure is NOT schedule-only (ADR-0049), and the
  // platform's own build-time lint cannot see this shape
  // because it is only knowable at run time. Measured on 17.0.0-rc.2: a
  // user-less run refuses the very first data node — "[runAs] refusing a data
  // operation (object 'crm_case', event 'record-after-update')" — so a case
  // raised by the seed loader, an integration, or another runAs:'system'
  // flow's write silently keeps its critical priority forever.
  //
  // Elevating the USER-driven runs too is correct here: escalation is a
  // service-level policy, not the writer's own edit. Both data nodes are keyed
  // to `{record.id}` — the row that just fired the trigger — so user scope
  // buys no restriction that matters, while it does add a failure mode: an
  // agent may legitimately raise a case without holding edit rights on the
  // escalation lifecycle fields (`is_escalated` / `escalated_date` / `status`).
  // This also puts the flow on the same footing as `case_sla_monitor`, which
  // performs the same escalation on a schedule under `runAs: 'system'`.

      // is an ordinary state — this repo ships `scripts/backfill-owner-id.ts`
      // and `pnpm backfill:owner` precisely because ownerless rows happen, and
      // ordinary REST creation / import reach the same state. `notify_team`
      // below addresses exactly ONE recipient, so an ownerless case leaves it
      // with an empty slate, which the builtin node treats as a HARD failure:
      // `execute` returns `success: false`, `executeNode` turns that into a
      // throw, and the run ends `status: 'failed'`.
      //
      // BLAST RADIUS, stated precisely because it differs from the sibling
      // defect in `case_sla_monitor` and the difference is structural: these two
      // are `record_change` flows with NO loop, so one ownerless case kills only
      // its OWN run — there is no queue of other records behind it. A `schedule`
      // flow whose work sits inside a `loop` awaits `runRegion` with no
      // try/catch, and there one ownerless row takes down every record ordered
      // behind it.
      //
      // ⛔ The gate sits AFTER `assign_senior_agent`, which stays
      // UNCONDITIONAL: the escalation itself must still land (measured
      // `is_escalated: true`, `status: 'escalated'` on every failing run), so an
      // ownerless critical case stays visible in views and reports. Only the
      // notify is gated — and here that loses nothing a reader would want,
      // because `caseRecord` is read by `get_case` UPSTREAM of the escalation
      // write, so `{caseRecord.owner_id}` is deliberately the owner the case had
      // BEFORE the hand-off. With no such person there is no "previous owner"
      // for the message to be addressed to.
      //
      // ⚠️ This guard is exactly the duplication objectstack#13682 exists to
      // retire — `notify` should treat an empty audience as a RECORDED SKIP
      // rather than a hard failure. When that lands, delete this node and edge
      // `e4`'s predicate here, and the same pair in `case-sla-monitor.flow.ts`.

    // `evaluateCondition` on the shape it alone covers, by dropping it and
    // recording what the rest do:
    //   - `has(vars.caseRecord)` — an UNBOUND root. Without it the predicate
    //     aborts with `No such key: caseRecord`. `get_case` binds the variable
    //     on every path here (it sets it even when it matched nothing), so this
    //     term is what keeps a future graph edit from turning a gate into an
    //     abort — and the `vars.`-scoped `has()` pair is the house rule
    //     `test/flow-variable-conditions.test.ts` enforces.
    //   - `has(vars.caseRecord.owner_id)` — the ABSENT key. Without it,
    //     `vars.caseRecord.owner_id != null` aborts with `No such key: owner_id`.
    //   - `vars.caseRecord.owner_id != null` — the explicit NULL. Without it the
    //     wrap is handed one and aborts with `no matching overload for
    //     'string(null)'`, so this term must short-circuit in front of it.
    //   - `string(...).trim() != ""` — the BLANK/whitespace id. `'   ' != ""` is
    //     TRUE in CEL, so a gate written that way opens for a whitespace
    //     `owner_id` and reproduces this very defect one input narrower. The
    //     `string()` wrap is not decoration either: measured, a bare `.trim()`
    //     on a numeric id aborts with `no matching overload for
    //     'double.trim()'` and `.matches()` with `'double.matches(string)'` — a
    //     thrown condition, the fault mode this gate exists to remove.
    //
    // ⛔ Do NOT add a `vars.caseRecord != null` term for the row that is GONE by
    // the time `get_case` reads it. Measured INERT: `get_record` with no match
    // sets the variable to `null`, key present, and `has()` on a null base
    // answers `false` rather than aborting, so the four terms above already
    // close that shape (`test/flow-escalation-ownerless-case.test.ts` covers

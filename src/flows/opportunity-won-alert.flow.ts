/**
 * Large-deal-won alert — record-change flow on opportunity update.
 *
 * When a deal of $100K or more is marked closed_won, notify the owner — the
 * owner alone, not their manager (see the notify node for why the manager
 * cannot be reached).
 *
 * The cut is INCLUSIVE (`>=`): `LARGE_DEAL_AMOUNT` must mean one thing across
 * this alert, the approval entry gate and both sharing rules, so a deal at
 * exactly $100,000 is announced on win for the same reason it is shared with
 * leadership. ⛔ Never let this site and the sharing rules cut differently — a
 * deal on the line then becomes visible to leadership and invisible to
 * governance.
 *
 * NB: `record.amount >= 100000` is authored as bare CEL against the
 * (string-serialized) currency field, which relies on the 7.7 numeric-hydration
 * fix; pre-7.7 it would have needed `double(record.amount)`.

/**
 * A guard's refusal must name the record that is refusing — never the record
 * the caller "must have" addressed (#693).
 *
 * ### What went wrong
 *
 * Found in the 17.0 GA acceptance sweep, tearing down a converted-lead chain:
 *
 *     DELETE /api/v1/data/crm_account/<id>
 *     → 400 "Cannot delete contact: still referenced by 1 open opportunity(ies),
 *            0 active quote(s), 0 active contract(s)"
 *
 *     DELETE /api/v1/data/crm_opportunity/<id>
 *     → 400 "Cannot edit a converted lead (attempted: converted_opportunity).
 *            Make changes on the converted record…"
 *
 * Both refusals are CORRECT — and both describe a different object, and in the
 * second case a different operation, than the caller performed. The reader is
 * sent to the wrong record, and the second one advises editing the very record
 * the caller asked to delete.
 *
 * ### Why the hooks cannot simply say "delete"
 *
 * Each guard has TWO invocation contexts and no way to tell them apart:
 *
 * - `contact_integrity`'s `beforeDelete` runs on a direct contact delete AND as
 *   a cascade child of an account delete (`crm_contact.crm_account` is a
 *   master-detail with `deleteBehavior: 'cascade'`).
 * - The `beforeUpdate` locks (`lead_automation`, `opportunity_lifecycle`,
 *   `quote_workflow`) run on a hand edit AND on the engine's referential clear:
 *   `cascadeDeleteRelations` implements `set_null` by UPDATING the row that
 *   holds the lookup, so deleting the referenced record arrives at the guard as
 *   `{ <field>: null }`.
 *
 * Measured on 17.0.0-rc.2 (pinned by the first test below), the hook context in
 * the cascade case carries no marker at all: the same keys, and a `session`
 * that is the caller's own. So the fix is not to detect the cascade — it is to
 * phrase every refusal from the BLOCKING RELATIONSHIP, which is true in both
 * contexts. The messages name the refusing record, the references that block,
 * and what to do.
 *
 * ⚠️ Superseded in part by #720. The three `beforeUpdate` locks no longer refuse
 * the referential clear at all — they yield to it on the write SHAPE, so those
 * deletes now succeed and their refusal messages have been deleted rather than
 * re-worded. That half moved to `test/freeze-guard-reference-cleanup.test.ts`.
 * The `beforeDelete` half below is untouched and still refuses.
 *
 * ### Why this file boots a real kernel
 *
 * `test/hooks-runtime*.test.ts` call the handlers directly, which proves the
 * wording but not that a cascade produces it. Only the engine's own referential
 * pass can show that `DELETE crm_account` ends in the contact guard — and it is
 * the engine that decides which guard gets there first. Everything below is the
 * message a real `DELETE` returns.

 * two sibling freeze guards on the same construction.
 *
 * #720 ruled (maintainer, 2026-08-11) that a frozen record must not make the
 * records it points at undeletable: all three guards now YIELD to the engine's
 * reference-cleanup write shape, so the cascade completes and there is no
 * sentence left to phrase. The message this file used to pin here —
 * "…its link(s) X cannot be cleared — which also blocks deleting the record(s)
 * they point at" — is gone from the three hooks, and with it the whole reason a
 * caller ever saw it.
 *
 * Those cases now live, as successful deletes plus the narrowness that keeps
 * ordinary edits refused, in `test/freeze-guard-reference-cleanup.test.ts`.
 * What stays HERE is #693's other half, which #720 did not touch: refusals that
 * are still correct (`contact_integrity`, `account_protection`) and must still
 * name the record that is refusing.
 */

// ───────────────────── the account guard's own sentence, measured (#721) ──

/**
 * `account_protection`'s open-opportunity refusal, taken from a real `DELETE`.
 *
 * Not a cascade case — nothing cascades INTO `crm_account`, so this guard only
 * ever answers a caller who addressed the account, and "Cannot delete customer
 * account" was already accurate (#721 says so explicitly). What was wrong was
 * agreement: the count switched the noun (`opportunit{y,ies}`) and left the
 * verb and the closing pronoun plural, so one open deal produced
 *
 *     Cannot delete customer account: 1 open opportunity still reference it.
 *     Close or reassign them first.
 *
 * It lives in this file because this is where the app boots a real kernel: the
 * unit pins in `hooks-runtime-sales.test.ts` call the handler directly, which
 * proves the string the handler builds, not the string a user is shown. Both
 * branches are measured here end-to-end, because only one of them was broken
 * and the fix must not trade one wrong sentence for the other.

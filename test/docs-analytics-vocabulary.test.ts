/**
 * The analytics landing page, and the cube vocabulary around it, pinned to
 * source (#976, #977).
 *
 * `content/docs/analytics/index.mdx` is the first screen a reader of the
 * analytics docs sees, and every count on it was a count of something else.
 * PR #954 / #975 had already written `analytics/reports` and `analytics/cubes`
 * to source; the landing page in front of them still promised *four cubes*,
 * *four dashboards*, *10+ reports including contracts*, a *Pipeline by Stage*
 * report, an *Analytics* navigation group and a Copilot reading cubes directly.
 * Eight further pages carried the same retired vocabulary (#977), two of them
 * concretely: a `src/cubes/` directory removed in #492, and a cube refresh
 * cadence nothing in `src/` configures.
 *
 * Nothing caught any of it: `os validate` and `pnpm lint` walk authored
 * metadata and never open `content/docs`, so — as with the service-index guard
 * in `docs-service-index-analytics.test.ts` (#948) and the quick-tour one in
 * `docs-quick-tour-navigation.test.ts` (#960) — the check has to live where the
 * claim lives.
 *
 * ## What is derived, and what is authored
 *
 * Every number and product name below is READ FROM `src/`: dashboard labels off
 * the dashboard barrel, report labels off the report barrel, the dataset count
 * off the dataset barrel, the navigation group and its children off
 * `CrmApp.navigation`, the refresh cadence off each dashboard's
 * `refreshIntervalSeconds`. Change the app and this file goes red at PR time, in all
 * three locales — the failure mode the landing page had for months.
 *
 * The authored parts are the count WORDS (the pages spell them, and each is
 * asserted against its derived figure in the last describe) and {@link PHANTOMS}
 * — names the old page carried that resolve to nothing in the app. The
 * typography convention #927 / PR #932 established carries the distinction, and
 * the quick-tour guard leans on the same one: **bold** is reserved for names the
 * app really has, *italic* for a name a reader arrives with that the product
 * does not carry. A phantom must still be NAMED — say where the thing really
 * lives, do not delete it silently — and must never be bolded.
 *
 * ## Why the nav rules are scoped to one section
 *
 * *Dashboards*, *Reports* and *Cubes* are phantoms only as NAVIGATION items:
 * nothing in the sidebar carries those labels. They are perfectly real as the
 * three docs pages this page links to, and the "What's included" table bolds
 * them in exactly that sense. So the bold/italic rules run over the "Where to
 * find things" block alone, the way `docs-quick-tour-navigation.test.ts` scopes
 * its rules to the left-nav block, rather than over the whole page.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (#976)
 *
 * Predicted direction: **red before this PR's content fix, green after**, and
 * measured that way — on the pre-fix page every locale failed at least four
 * rules: the dashboard count (4 against the barrel's 5), the report count
 * (`10+` plus a contract claim against the barrel's 10 with no contract
 * report), the nav block (which named an *Analytics* group and bolded
 * *Dashboards* / *Reports* / *Cubes* as if they were sidebar items) and the
 * Insights-children rule (that group was absent entirely). No rule here can
 * pass by asserting nothing: each documented count is paired with the derived
 * figure it came from, and both tree walks carry a vacuity guard.

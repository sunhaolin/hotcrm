/**
 * ═══ HotCRM has ONE owner, and it is the platform's (#548) ════════════════
 *
 * Every business object used to author its own `owner` lookup while the
 * platform kept a separate `owner_id` beside it. Only `owner_id` was ever read
 * by OWD, sharing rules, owner-scope widening or the `is_private` row filter —
 * so "Owner" on a form was a label, not a permission, and reassigning it moved
 * the record in every list and report while moving no access at all. #548
 * deleted the second column.
 *
 * Collapsing to one column moves ownership writes UNDER the platform's transfer
 * gate: `owner_id` is system-managed for non-privileged writers, and a write
 * that plants a record under another user (insert) or reassigns one (update) is
 * denied without `allowTransfer` — enforced today through the ordinary
 * insert/update door, not merely declared (`@objectstack/spec`
 * `security/permission.zod.ts`, the #3004 guard; implemented in
 * `@objectstack/plugin-security`'s operation middleware).
 *
 * That gate is a PLATFORM behaviour with platform tests of its own. What this
 * file pins is the part the app's correctness actually rests on, and which no
 * platform test can answer: **which of HotCRM's own writers the gate can even
 * see**. The answer is not uniform, and getting it wrong in either direction is
 * expensive — assume the gate applies where it does not and the round-robin
 * gets a grant it never needed; assume it does not where it does and case
 * escalation 403s in production.
 *
 * Three seams, three different answers, each measured below against a real
 * ObjectQL rather than reasoned about:
 *
 *   1. a `beforeInsert` hook mutating `input` — INVISIBLE to the gate, because
 *      the gate is an operation middleware wrapping the whole call and the hook
 *      phase runs inside it. This is why `lead_auto_assign` can round-robin a
 *      lead onto another rep with no transfer grant.
 *   2. a hook's `ctx.api` write — a NEW operation carrying the SAME context, so
 *      the gate does see it. This is why `case.hook.ts` opening an escalation
 *      task under the account owner needs `service_agent.crm_task.allowTransfer`.
 *   3. an insert that leaves `owner_id` empty — stamped to the acting user by
 *      the same middleware, which is what makes "new records belong to their
 *      creator" survive the deletion of the old `defaultValue: os.user.id`.
 *
 * The middleware itself is not installed here (`@objectstack/plugin-security` is
 * not a dependency of this app, and standing one up would test the platform's
 * code, not ours). Seams 1 and 2 are therefore measured through a RECORDING
 * middleware registered on the same `registerMiddleware` seam the security
 * plugin uses: what that recorder can see, the guard can see, and what it
 * cannot see, the guard cannot either. Seam 3 is asserted on the app's metadata
 * — that nothing in the schema fills `owner_id`, so the middleware stamp is the
 * only thing that can.

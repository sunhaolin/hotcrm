/**
 * A frozen record must not make the people it references undeletable (#720).
 *
 * ### The defect
 *
 * The engine implements `deleteBehavior: 'set_null'` by UPDATING the row that
 * HOLDS the lookup. So "delete the contact" reaches the holder's `beforeUpdate`
 * as `{ <link>: null }` — and this app's three freeze/lock guards
 * (`lead_automation`, `opportunity_lifecycle`, `quote_workflow`) refused it,
 * because they are written to stop USER edits to settled records and a cascade
 * looks exactly like one. The consequence was not a wording problem:
 *
 *   - a contact whose only referent was a CLOSED opportunity could never be
 *     deleted, and `crm_contact.crm_account` is a master-detail with
 *     `deleteBehavior: 'cascade'`, so that contact's ACCOUNT could not be
 *     deleted either — a GDPR erasure request with no way to carry it out;
 *   - the two escapes on offer were destroying sales history (delete the
 *     closed deal) or asking an admin for a system write.
 *
 * Maintainer's ruling of 2026-08-11 on #720 is Option A: the guards yield to
 * the engine's reference-cleanup write shape, and the yield must be narrow.
 *
 * ### The measurement the yield rests on
 *
 * Re-taken on `@objectstack/*` 17.1.0 — the version this repo pinned AT THE
 * TIME of the measurement, not the current pin (#1676: this repo has pinned
 * 17.3.0 since PR #1577, and the CONTEXT table below has not been re-taken on
 * it, though this file's own behavioural assertions do run green there) — by
 * registering a probe hook at priority 199 (immediately ahead of each guard) on
 * `crm_opportunity`, `crm_quote` and `crm_lead`, and varying the one thing an
 * earlier taking of this table held fixed: the CONTEXT handed to the `DELETE`.
 * That is the variable the whole table turns on, because the engine builds its
 * cleanup write as
 * `{ ...callerContext, transaction, __referentialFieldClear: true }` — it
 * INHERITS whatever identity the caller supplied:
 *
 *     ctx on the DELETE     cascade input        ctx.user   ctx.session    api.executionContext
 *     { userId, isSystem }  { id, LINK: null,    the        { userId,      { userId, isSystem,
 *      — what a REST          updated_at,        CALLER       isSystem }     transaction,
 *        DELETE carries       updated_by }                                   __referentialFieldClear }
 *     { isSystem }          { id, LINK: null,    undefined  { isSystem }   { isSystem, transaction,
 *                             updated_at }                                   __referentialFieldClear }
 *     none at all           { id, LINK: null,    undefined  undefined      { transaction,
 *                             updated_at }                                   __referentialFieldClear }
 *
 * and, against the top row, the same user's hand-clear of the SAME lookup —
 * the comparison the yield actually has to survive:
 *
 *     hand-clear            { id, LINK: null,    the        { userId,      { userId, isSystem }
 *      (a user's)             updated_at,        CALLER       isSystem }
 *                             updated_by }
 *
 * ⇒ On the path this app takes — row 1 — the cascade and the hand-clear are
 * IDENTICAL in `input`, in `ctx.user` and in `ctx.session`. `provenance` is
 * `undefined` on both. All three objects produce that same pair, which is why
 * one predicate serves all three and no per-object differentiation was needed.
 *
 * ⚠️ An earlier version of this table put the BOTTOM row in the cascade column
 * — no `updated_by`, `user` and `session` `undefined` — and read it as a
 * property of the ENGINE's write. It is not. It is a property of the `DELETE`
 * the rig happened to issue, which carried no `userId`. `updated_by` and the
 * identity are ONE fact, not two: both appear exactly when the `DELETE` carried
 * a caller, and both vanish together when it did not. So the 17.0.0-rc.6
 * reading this file once carried — the caller's `user` and `session` on the
 * cascade too — was right about this app's path, and the "that is no longer
 * true" correction that replaced it was itself the rig artefact (#1424).
 *
 * ⛔ Do NOT turn the bottom two rows into a discriminator either. `!ctx.session`
 * means "no identity envelope was supplied" — `buildSession`'s own documented
 * contract — which is equally true of any bare-kernel, seed or programmatic
 * write. Reading it as "this is a reference cleanup" would yield the freeze for
 * a whole class of writes that are not one, AND would still miss every cleanup
 * a real user triggers, which is all of them.
 *
 * ### The marker EXISTS, it is reachable from a hook, and it is still not read
 *
 * An earlier version of this note said the opposite — "the marker is not
 * offered to hooks, so the WRITE SHAPE is the only evidence there is" — and
 * that conclusion was measurably wrong on the version we ship. It is corrected
 * here rather than deleted, because its job was to tell the next reader not to
 * look any further, and a note that keeps a reader away from the truth is
 * worse than no note (#1165).
 *
 * The engine tags its own cleanup write with `__referentialFieldClear: true`
 * (`ObjectQL.cascadeDeleteRelations` builds
 * `referentialCtx = { ...context, __referentialFieldClear: true }`), and on
 * 17.1.0 that tag IS readable from a hook — at
 *
 *     ctx.api.executionContext.__referentialFieldClear
 *
 * measured `true` on all three cascade writes above, and `undefined` on all
 * three hand-clears. The old note reasoned only about `ctx.session`, and that
 * half of it remains correct: `buildSession` builds the session field by field
 * from a fixed, named allow-list, and `__`-prefixed operation-private keys are
 * deliberately not in it (a rule, not an oversight — see the `__` convention
 * note in `@objectstack/core`). `ctx.session` is simply not the only route
 * into the context.
 *
 * The marker answers a question the shape predicate cannot even approximate.
 * Shape does NOT separate these two writes — not narrowly, not by luck. An
 * earlier version of this note said it did, "because the engine happens to omit
 * `updated_by` on the cascade"; that sentence was read off the artefact table
 * above, and it was false twice over. `updated_by` is in every guard's
 * `SYSTEM_FIELDS` set, so no predicate in this repo has ever read it — its
 * presence or absence could not separate anything even if it did vary. And on
 * this app's path it does not vary: both writes clear the same declared link
 * from a value to `null`, carry the same audit columns, run as the same user,
 * and leave the referenced row still readable.
 *
 * So the predicate below is not a fail-safe approximation of "is this the
 * engine?" — it does not answer that question at all, and the narrowness is not
 * what keeps it honest about provenance. What it is is a deliberate WIDENING:
 * it lets ANY caller clear a declared link on a settled record. That is the
 * trade the 2026-08-11 ruling accepted, not a side effect of it. "Pinned
 * narrow" means narrow in the SHAPE it admits — a lone declared link, value to
 * `null`, nothing riding along — and never narrow in WHO may send that shape.
 *
 * ⛔ Even so, the guards deliberately do NOT read the marker. The ruling on
 * #1165 (2026-08-25) reviewed both reasons and upheld them:
 *
 *   1. It is an OPERATION-PRIVATE key. The `__` prefix is the platform's own
 *      convention for "not part of the contract" — the same convention
 *      `buildSession` enforces when it leaves those keys out. Building app
 *      correctness on it is an UNDECLARED DEPENDENCY that can vanish in a
 *      patch release without anyone calling it a break.
 *   2. Reachability through the SHIPPED path is UNPROVEN. The reading above was
 *      taken in this kernel rig, where handlers run natively and `ctx.api` is
 *      the engine's own `ScopedContext` (keys measured as
 *      `[engine, executionContext, joinedHandles]`). In production a hook body
 *      runs body-only inside QuickJS (see `test/action-sandbox.test.ts`), and
 *      `ctx.api` there is whatever `buildSandboxApi` hands it: `engineCtx.api`
 *      when that exposes `object()`, and OTHERWISE a shim of `{ object }`
 *      carrying no `executionContext` at all. A predicate reading the marker
 *      could be green here and silently false in production — the worst
 *      available outcome for a guard. Same family as
 *      `ctx.dispatch?.mode === 'per-row'` (#1265 / objectstack#11552), a shape
 *      this repo has already paid for once.
 *
 * ### What would have to change upstream for that to flip
 *
 * A first-class, DECLARED marker on the hook context: `ctx.referentialFieldClear`,
 * declared on `HookContextSchema` in `packages/spec` and populated on every
 * cleanup write — declared, so it is part of the contract and crosses the
 * sandbox boundary by design rather than by luck. That is the half
 * `__referentialFieldClear` cannot offer at any level of care on this side.
 * Filed upstream as objectstack-ai/objectstack#13644.
 *
 * ⚠️ The correction above STRENGTHENS that ask, and #13644 carried the
 * uncorrected table for a while, so read it with this file rather than the
 * other way round. The old reading implied an app had a shape fallback that was
 * unsound but fails safe — worse than a declared marker, yet something. The
 * truth is that on the path a REST `DELETE` takes there is NO discriminator
 * available to an app at all, except the operation-private key it has been
 * ruled against reading. The ask is not "give us a tidier signal"; it is "there
 * is no supported signal, and apps are guessing".
 *
 * When it lands: the three verbatim copies of the predicate collapse into one
 * honest read, #720's narrowness caveats stop being load-bearing, and the
 * `REFERENCE_FIELDS`-completeness pin at the bottom of this file becomes
 * unnecessary — that pin is where to start.
 *
 * ### The other file that measured this, and why the two once disagreed
 *
 * `test/lead-duplicate-link-cleanup.test.ts` (#1072) takes the same reading for
 * `crm_lead.duplicate_of_contact`, and AGREES with the table above: identical
 * `input` (`{ id, <link>: null, updated_at, updated_by }`), identical
 * `ctx.user`, identical `ctx.session` on the cascade and the hand edit alike.
 * It reached that from the opposite direction — it asks "is the pair still
 * whole?", a question needing no provenance, so its note records the sameness
 * as the reason NOT to sniff rather than as a caveat on sniffing.
 *
 * The two files disagreed for one reason, and it is worth remembering because
 * it is not a reading error: this file varied the caller context and that one
 * did not. `lead-duplicate-link-cleanup.test.ts` measured its cascade through a
 * `DELETE` carrying a real `userId` (the only path it cares about); this file's
 * table was taken through an identity-less `DELETE` and then written down as
 * "the engine's cleanup write", generalising a rig setting into a platform
 * fact. Both files were labelled measurements and only one of them had varied
 * the variable — which is why the disagreement survived two rounds of review
 * and propagated into an upstream issue before anyone re-took it.
 *
 * ⇒ If a third file ever needs this reading, state the DELETE's context beside
 * the numbers. A cascade table without that column is not a measurement of the
 * engine; it is a measurement of whoever pressed delete.
 *
 * ### Why the narrowness is pinned in both directions
 *
 * The yield is not "tolerate null". A write passes only when EVERY one of its
 * non-system changes is a declared link going from a value to `null`. One
 * business field alongside the null, or a link repointed to a new value, and
 * the freeze refuses exactly as before. Both directions are asserted here,
 * because a suite that goes green by dropping the refusals would look identical
 * to one that goes green by fixing the bug.
 *
 * ### On the refusal envelope
 *
 * This block used to record the opposite of what it records now, and the change
 * is the point. Measured on rc.6, every refusal these guards raised reached the
 * caller as a bare `Error` with `code` and `status` both `undefined`; the
 * envelope was pinned as the absent thing it measurably was, and the pin was
 * declared a tripwire rather than an endorsement. #1075 landed the envelope, so
 * the tripwire fired and this is its strengthened form: the same wording pins
 * (PR #719 wrote that contract and it is unchanged) PLUS the `code`/`status`
 * these guards now carry. All three freeze guards refuse with the same class —
 * the record's own state froze the field the write touched — so all three
 * assert `RECORD_LOCKED` / 409 from `REFUSAL_CODES.locked`.

/**
 * ═══ HOUSE RULE: there is exactly ONE definition of a "large deal" ═════════
 *
 * Before #599 the question "how big is a large deal?" was answered by four
 * independent numeric literals in three files — the approval entry gate, the
 * won-deal alert, and two sharing rules — plus a second tier stated twice in
 * complementary polarity for the director step. Nothing joined them, so a
 * deployment that raised the bar in one place shipped a product where a deal is
 * large enough for the director to SEE and not large enough to APPROVE.
 *
 * `src/objects/_thresholds.ts` is now the only place the numbers are written,
 * and every consumer interpolates it. That is a claim about the repo, not about
 * a function, and it is exactly the kind of claim that decays quietly: each
 * consumer keeps working when it falls out of step, it just stops answering the
 * same question. So this file reads the numbers back out of the SHIPPED
 * metadata — the compiled CEL of every flow condition and sharing rule — and
 * fails if any site stops agreeing.
 *
 * The companion guard is `test/docs-drift.test.ts`, which pins the published
 * prose in `src/docs/*.md` to the same compiled conditions.
 *
 * ### The VALUE and the OPERATOR are both converged (#599, then #1087)
 *
 * #599 converged the value and deliberately left the operators alone: approval
 * entry and the won alert cut at `> LARGE_DEAL_AMOUNT`, both sharing rules at
 * `>=`, so a deal at exactly $100,000.00 was shared with the sales director and
 * the executive and was neither routed for approval nor announced when it was
 * won — visible to leadership, invisible to governance.
 *
 * #1087 answered the product question that left open (**does a deal at exactly
 * the threshold count as large? — yes**) and converged every site on `>=`. The
 * `BOUNDARY` block below is what states that: one line, and above it — at it,
 * inclusive — everything applies. It is the assertion that fails if a future
 * author flips one site back, which is the same drift by another name.

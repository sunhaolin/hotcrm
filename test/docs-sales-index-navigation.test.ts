/**
 * The sales index page's "Where to find things" section, pinned to the Sales
 * navigation group (#997).
 *
 * The section's whole job is "here is what the sidebar's Sales group holds",
 * and it held eight of the group's nine entries. The missing one was
 * **Account Workbench** — an ADR-0047 interface page
 * (`src/pages/account_workbench.page.ts`), with a real label in every locale
 * bundle, sitting third in the group — so the page told a new reader it does
 * not exist, or that the sidebar they were looking at was broken.
 *
 * The same fact was already right one page over:
 * `content/docs/getting-started/quick-tour.mdx` lists all nine, and
 * `docs-quick-tour-navigation.test.ts` (#960) pins that list item-for-item. Two
 * pages, one question, two answers — and only one of them had a guard. This
 * file is the other guard, and it is why the same drift cannot recur here: add
 * a nav item to the Sales group without touching this section and it goes red,
 * in all three locales, the way #938 (marketing/index, Products) and #927
 * (service/index, Knowledge) each had to be found by hand.
 *
 * The rules are shaped around the section's own layout, which differs by
 * locale in exactly one respect worth knowing:
 *
 *  - the six OBJECT entries share one `·`-separated bullet. The zh pages
 *    translate those six names, so they cannot be matched against the English
 *    labels — what is pinned instead is the COUNT, which catches a seventh
 *    object entry landing in the group in every locale. The en page is checked
 *    label-for-label on top of that.
 *  - the three NON-object entries get a bullet each, and every locale spells
 *    the English label there (bare on en, in parentheses on the zh pages), so
 *    those are matched by label everywhere.
 *  - the group size is stated in prose and must match the group.

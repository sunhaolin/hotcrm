/**
 * The suspected-duplicate flag reaches the two surfaces that can act on it (#1207).
 *
 * `lead_duplicate_check` (`src/objects/lead.hook.ts`, job 2) detects a
 * re-captured email at intake, writes `duplicate_status: 'suspected'` and links
 * the record the lead repeats. Both halves worked. Neither reached a rep: the
 * record page never mentioned the flag, and `Convert Lead` asked one question
 * ("create an opportunity?") without ever looking at it — so a flagged lead
 * converted into a SECOND account, contact and opportunity, two reps worked the
 * same buyer, and the pipeline counted the deal twice.
 *
 * The `suspected_duplicates` queue view is not the answer to that and is not
 * touched here: it is the reviewer's slow path. This file pins the fast path —
 * the rep who has the record open, and the rep who is one click from converting
 * it.
 *
 * ## Two surfaces, two mechanisms, two different failure modes
 *
 * | surface | carries | unevaluable predicate ⇒ |
 * | ------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
 * | `lead_detail_page` `record:alert` ×2 | `properties.visible`, client CEL | FAIL-SOFT: banner SHOWN |
 * |   (console 17.4.0 rejects `has()` / `in` — see the measurement below) | | |
 * | `lead_conversion` edges `e21`/`e22`/`e25` | flow condition, server CEL | RUN FAILS |
 *
 * They fail in opposite directions and both are ugly: a fail-soft banner cries
 * wolf on every clean lead (and a warning nobody believes is worse than no
 * warning), while a failing run makes an ordinary lead unconvertible. One
 * discipline covers both — `has()` guards, so the predicate returns a VERDICT
 * for every record shape a driver can hand it, including the shapes where the
 * column is simply absent (`driver-memory` / `driver-mongodb`; `driver-sql`
 * returns it as null). This file measures that on the real engines rather than
 * asserting the text of the predicates.
 *
 * The same house rule, on its other three surfaces, is stated in
 * `test/object-validation-predicates.test.ts` (object `validations[]`),
 * `test/flow-condition-totality.test.ts` (record-change flow conditions) and
 * `test/view-predicate-dialect.test.ts` (view `visibleWhen`). This is the
 * fourth: a record PAGE component predicate.
 *
 * ## One banner per verdict (#1628)
 *
 * The record-page half is TWO `record:alert` components, not one. #1207 gated
 * a single banner on `suspected`; #1289 widened it to every verdict and, being
 * one component with one `visible` and one title/body pair, had to word it so
 * it named NEITHER state. Since #1288 the two verdicts have opposite next
 * steps — `suspected` warns and conversion proceeds, `confirmed` is refused —
 * so the neutral wording told the rep something was wrong without telling them
 * what to do. Splitting the component is what buys that back, and it moves
 * three of the pins below: the shape, the predicates, and the copy rule, which
 * INVERTS from "names neither verdict" to "names its own and never the other".

   * ⛔ Do not put `has()` (or `in`) back on this surface without re-measuring

/**
 * The refusal, and the three states it partitions the flag into (#1288).
 *
 * Ruled 2026-08-31: interception stands on a PERSON's judgement. A lead a
 * reviewer marked `confirmed` is refused conversion, with copy naming the
 * verdict and the surviving record; the machine's `suspected` guess keeps
 * #1207's warn-and-allow, because `lead_duplicate_check` matches on email
 * EQUALITY and shared inboxes make false positives certain — blocking on a
 * guess would need an override flag, and an override flag is the shape this
 * exhibit must not demonstrate.
 *
 * ## Why these pins resume the run instead of reading the screen
 *
 * A paused run has created nothing on ANY branch yet, so a pin that stopped at
 * the pause would be green against a flow with no refusal in it at all. Each
 * case below submits the screen it stopped on and then counts what the store
 * holds — the refusal is the four zeroes, not the dialog.
 *
 * ## The before-picture these replace
 *
 * Measured on the parent commit, through this same harness: a `confirmed` lead
 * suspended on `screen_1` with NO description (the #1207 warning is gated on
 * `suspected`) and then converted — one account, one contact, one opportunity,
 * `is_converted: true`. All three of `crm_lead` / `crm_contact` / `erased`
 * survivors did. That is the behaviour the changeset announces changing.

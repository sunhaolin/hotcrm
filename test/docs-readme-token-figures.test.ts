/**
 * The README headline figures are the gate's, within the ruled buffer (#1187).
 *
 * The README banner states HotCRM's positioning claim as two measured numbers:
 * business semantics ~81k tokens, interaction layer ~39k. That claim is the
 * first thing a reader sees and the reason a developer keeps reading, and for
 * months nothing checked it — the banner said "~170k tokens (~18,000 lines)", a
 * hand measurement of a tree that had since moved, and no test, gate or reviewer
 * could have noticed. #1183 built the measurement
 * (`scripts/check-source-token-ratchet.mjs`); this file wires the README to it,
 * so the next drift fails CI instead of surviving to the next audit.
 *
 * ## Why this is a sibling of `docs-drift.test.ts` and not a block inside it
 *
 * This rule belongs to that file's "a doc states a number that must match the
 * source of truth" family — the #729 count rule is its closest relative and the
 * model for how it reads its expectations; that rule is
 * `test/docs-metadata-counts.test.ts` since #1196. It shipped as its own file
 * because `docs-drift.test.ts` was 100,190 bytes against the 102,400-byte
 * ceiling in `scripts/check-source-hygiene.mjs`: appending this block put it at
 * 107KB and turned the hygiene gate red. #1196 has since split that file along
 * its family seams, so the ceiling is no longer what keeps this rule out of it —
 * the subject is. A dedicated `test/docs-*.test.ts` per docs rule family is this
 * repo's standing shape, so this follows the convention rather than inventing
 * one.
 *
 * ## Why a tolerance, and why exactly 5%
 *
 * A rule demanding the banner equal today's rounded reading would re-create the
 * defect one decimal place down: the measurement moved 80,411 → 80,356 → 81,233
 * → 80,767 in a single working day as four ordinary PRs landed, and the rounded
 * headline crossed the ~80k/~81k boundary twice. A README PR per rounding step
 * is not a guard, it is a tax — and the first person to pay it twice deletes the
 * guard.
 *
 * So the banner is held to the maintainer's already-ruled working buffer rather
 * than to a fresh number invented here: 「给 5% 缓冲」 (2026-08-17), the same 5%
 * the ratchet's ceilings carry via its `anchor()`. Reusing it keeps one buffer
 * in this repo rather than two that drift apart.
 *
 * ## What this rule is FOR, since #1601: honesty, not a budget
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-09-05 (verbatim, kept untranslated):
 *
 *   「解耦:banner 钉实测,ceiling 独立」
 *
 * The banner is pinned to the MEASURED reading; the ceiling stands on its own.
 * So this rule caps nothing. Its whole job is that the README may not advertise
 * a size the app does not have — the ratchet owns the growth budget, alone, and
 * a raise there sits on the maintainer floor where it always did.
 *
 *   business semantics  banner ~108k -> band 102,600–113,400 · ceiling 115,000
 *   interaction layer   banner ~48k -> band 45,600–50,400 · ceiling 50,000
 *
 * ⚠️ The ceiling column is still worked out per row, and still pinned to
 * `CEILINGS` below — that is what stops the README quoting a ceiling the gate no
 * longer commits. What it is NOT any more is an input to this rule. Until #1601
 * the paragraph here compared each band's upper edge against its ceiling and
 * argued from the result that the ratchet failed first on growth; that
 * comparison was the coupling, and it is gone. Which of the two reddens first on
 * growth is deliberately no longer a fact this file reasons from, because the
 * two reds are not paid in the same currency: this one is cleared by restating
 * the banner, which any PR may do, and the ratchet's only by shrinking the layer
 * or by another ruling.
 *
 * Shrinkage is the direction this rule owns alone: a banner left behind by a
 * shrinking tree breaks no ceiling, and only the band's lower edge objects.
 * Early is the safe direction for a doc guard; late is the one that cost #1187.
 *
 * ⚠️ That paragraph read the other way round until #1320 re-anchored the
 * interaction ceiling 42,000 -> 40,000. The table above went on saying 42,000,
 * and the paragraph went on arguing from it that this rule was the tighter of
 * the two — false from the moment the constant moved, and noticed by nobody,
 * because it was the one figure-bearing artefact in this family with no
 * producer-side pin. That is what the last `describe` below is: every field of
 * both rows read back off the README banner, the imported `BUFFER` and the
 * committed `CEILINGS`, so the next re-anchoring reddens this file instead of
 * quietly falsifying it (#1335).
 *
 * ## The measurement is the gate's, not a copy of it
 *
 * The expected values are read by RUNNING the gate in `--json` mode — the same
 * command CI runs — and are deliberately NOT written down here, for the reason
 * the #729 count rule gives: a hard-coded expectation is the same
 * hand-maintained number moved into the test file, stale on the very next merge.
 * It also keeps the layer definitions in exactly one place; if a new metadata
 * directory joins `business semantics`, this rule follows without being told.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification
 *
 * Predicted red-before / green-after, and measured both ways. Restoring the
 * pre-fix banner ("~170k tokens (~18,000 lines)") turns three of the five
 * assertions red, the vacuity guard reporting `0 match(es)` for both layers —
 * i.e. this rule would have caught the drift that opened #1187. Hand-corrupting
 * the interaction figure to ~41k — inside the ratchet ceiling but outside the
 * band — reddens the tolerance assertion alone, exactly as predicted:
 * `interaction layer: banner says ~41k, the gate measures 38,848
 * (band 38,950–43,050)`. Captured output is in the PR body.

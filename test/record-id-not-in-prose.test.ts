/**
 * No record id reaches a human in prose (#1243).
 *
 * #1208 closed one site of this class — the escalation follow-up task, pinned
 * next door in `test/escalation-task-subject.test.ts`. It survived in eight
 * more, across four hooks, and a walkthrough of `main` measured the cost: 15 of
 * 31 tasks in a demo org were titled by a 16-character primary key, and a
 * freshly drafted contract explained its own provenance as `Auto-drafted from
 * accepted quote MvNopWgEDZwm2T5L` — naming a quote every screen in the app
 * calls `QTE-0006`.
 *
 * The rule those eight sites now follow, stated once:
 *
 *   **A sentence a user reads names a record the way the UI names it — its
 *   `nameField`, composed from the stored columns behind it. The id goes in the
 *   relationship field that exists to carry it, or nowhere.**
 *
 * Three things make this file worth having on top of the per-hook suites:
 *
 *  1. **It asserts the ABSENCE, which the per-hook suites structurally cannot.**
 *     A regex like `/Quote Q-1001 is accepted/` matches the defective string
 *     `Quote Q-1001 (q1) is accepted` just as happily. Every case below feeds a
 *     sentinel id that appears nowhere else in the fixture and asserts the
 *     emitted prose does not contain it — the one assertion that fails on the
 *     old code.
 *  2. **It runs the LOWERED bodies.** Hook bodies ship body-only through
 *     QuickJS, so a title composed in a shared helper would be a `ReferenceError`
 *     in the shipped artifact while every closure-based test stayed green (the
 *     reasoning is written out in `escalation-task-subject.test.ts`). Composing
 *     a display title inline is exactly the temptation to factor out, so the
 *     pin runs what the artifact carries.
 *  3. **It states the boundary.** An id in a log line, an internal audit row or
 *     a machine-read field is the RIGHT thing there. `quote.hook.ts` keeps two
 *     such ids deliberately, and the source sweep at the bottom of this file
 *     encodes the difference — sink, not site — so the next instance of the
 *     class is a red build rather than another walkthrough.

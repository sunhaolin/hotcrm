/**
 * Every business object this app ships has a user-facing docs page (#672).
 *
 * ## The rule, and why it needed a guard
 *
 * AGENTS.md, Coding Standards: *"Every new object/feature requires user-facing
 * documentation under `content/docs/` … written for business users + admins
 * (not developers)."* Nothing enforced it. `os validate` and `pnpm lint` walk
 * authored metadata and never open `content/docs`, so the rule was a convention
 * — and #592 / PR #670 duly shipped `crm_event` and `crm_event_attendee` with a
 * nav group, six list views, a dashboard, a dataset and four permission sets,
 * and ZERO documentation. Neither object was named anywhere under
 * `content/docs/` until #672. A convention nothing checks is a convention that
 * survives exactly as long as nobody is busy.
 *
 * ## The criterion: which objects are "user-visible"
 *
 * **Every object this app authors — i.e. every registered object carrying the
 * `crm_` business prefix.** Platform `sys_*` objects are documented by the
 * platform, not here, and they are the only exclusion.
 *
 * The tempting narrower criterion — "objects reachable from app navigation" —
 * was measured and rejected: `crm_event_attendee` has no nav entry (it is
 * edited inside its parent's related list) and it is *precisely* the object
 * this guard exists for. A user meets it in a related list, in the attendee
 * columns of a report, and in the error message that refuses to delete a
 * meeting while its attendees are still there. "Has no tab" is not "invisible".
 *
 * ## The ledger, and what it costs to add an object
 *
 * {@link DOCS_LEDGER} maps each business object to the page that documents it.
 * The set on the left is derived from the compiled stack, never hand-listed, so
 * registering a new object turns this file red until a page exists for it. That
 * is the whole point: the ledger is the enforcement, not the documentation of
 * an enforcement that lives elsewhere.
 *
 * Two objects may legitimately share one page (a quote and its line items are
 * one story), and that is allowed — what is not allowed is an object with no
 * page at all.
 *
 * ## What each entry is checked for
 *
 *  1. The page exists in **all three locales** (`.mdx`, `.zh-Hans.mdx`,
 *     `.zh-Hant.mdx`) — a page that exists only in English is not documentation
 *     for the half of this product's audience that reads the zh pages.
 *  2. The page is **registered in its section's `meta.json`**, in all three
 *     locales. Fumadocs renders the sidebar from those files; an unregistered
 *     page is unreachable by navigation, which is indistinguishable from absent
 *     for anyone who is not already searching for it.
 *  3. The page **names the object** — by API name, `label`, `pluralLabel`, or
 *     the entry's `term` override for the handful of concepts the docs spell
 *     differently from the metadata ("line item", "article").
 *  4. The page is **not a developer page**. `content/docs/customization/
 *     api-reference.mdx` tabulates nearly every object in the app, so
 *     "mentioned somewhere under content/docs" would have been satisfied for
 *     free by an API table row. A row in a reference table is not user
 *     documentation, and a guard that accepts it enforces nothing.
 *
 * ## Locale asymmetry, stated rather than hidden
 *
 * Check 3 runs on the **English page only**. The zh pages translate the
 * business vocabulary (`Quote` → 报价 / 報價, `Case` → 工单 / 工單), so a
 * term match against the English label would fail on a perfectly good
 * translation, and per-locale term tables would be three ledgers to drift
 * instead of one. The translations are held to checks 1 and 2, which are
 * locale-honest: the page has to exist and be navigable in every locale.
 * Widen this if translated pages start going hollow — do not assume it is
 * already covered.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (#672)
 *
 * Predicted direction: **red**. Deleting `content/docs/sales/
 * meetings-and-calls.mdx` fails "the page exists in every locale" naming
 * `crm_event` and `crm_event_attendee`; deleting their ledger rows instead
 * fails "every registered business object has a ledger entry" with the same two
 * names. Both were run before this file was pushed.

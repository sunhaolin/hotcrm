/**
 * The refusal envelope, pinned where it actually ships (#1075 + #1167).
 *
 * # What was wrong
 *
 * Every business refusal in this app was a bare `throw new Error(msg)`, so
 * `resolveThrownHttpError` — the mapper `@objectstack/rest` uses — classified a
 * deliberate refusal as `500 / INTERNAL_ERROR`, a server fault. The only signal
 * a REST consumer had was the message string: prose, localised in places, and
 * the one part of a refusal that is MEANT to change (#693 / #719).
 *
 * # Why the helper is inline in every guard rather than imported
 *
 * A hook handler is lowered to a metadata-only `body.source` and evaluated in
 * QuickJS with no module scope. `extractHookBody` THROWS on a module-scope
 * reference, and the CLI build CATCHES that throw and silently bundles the
 * closure instead — so an imported `refuse()` would not go red anywhere, it
 * would just stop the hook shipping as pure metadata. The helper is therefore
 * inlined per handler, exactly as `account_protection` inlines the territory
 * table instead of importing `./_territory.ts`. This file removes the TRUST
 * that arrangement would otherwise require: each copy is read back out of the
 * LOWERED body and held to the declaration in `src/objects/_refusal.ts`.
 *
 * # Why the shipped path, and not the handler
 *
 * #1167: the in-process path is what this repo tests, and the body-only path is
 * what it ships. They differ — the shipped path re-throws as `SandboxError` and
 * rewrites the message to `hook 'NAME' threw: Error: ORIGINAL`, preserving the
 * original on `innerMessage`. More sharply, the sandbox marshals an allowlist
 * and drops everything else, so an envelope riding a key OUTSIDE it — `hint`,
 * `detail`, or a branch on `instanceof` — would pass a handler-level test and
 * be silently dead in production. Re-measured on 17.4.0 (#1863 / #1867): the
 * allowlist is FOUR properties — `code` as a non-empty string, `status` as a
 * finite number, `fields` as an array, `userMessage` as a string with
 * non-whitespace in it. This file said three, anchored to 17.1.0, and reached
 * for "a fourth key" as its example of something silently dead: `userMessage`
 * IS the fourth key, and it crosses. #1869 adopted it, so `refuse()` now writes
 * THREE of the four and the clean sentence reaches a consumer on a channel the
 * `hook 'NAME' threw:` rewrite cannot touch — `src/objects/_refusal.ts` carries
 * the reading and why the fourth argument defaults to the author's message.
 * `fields` stays declined. Every behavioural assertion below runs the lowered
 * body.
 *
 * The wording pins live alongside the envelope, never instead of it — the
 * phrasing is a real contract (#693 / #719).

/**
 * The automation docs page lists every flow the app ships, in every locale (#827).
 *
 * `content/docs/administration/automation.mdx` carries the "Built-in flows in
 * HotCRM" table, and that table is the ONLY place an admin can go from a
 * symptom ("something re-assigned this case", "a task appeared on my list") to
 * the automation that caused it. When the table is short, a reader does not
 * conclude "the table is incomplete" — they conclude "nothing automates this".
 *
 * It had drifted twice over, and neither drift was visible to any gate:
 *
 *   - **Half the rows were missing.** The header said `(11)` on the English page
 *     and `(10 个)` / `(10 個)` on the two Chinese ones, while the compiled stack
 *     shipped 24 flows. Contract auto-expiration was among the missing — and
 *     `content/docs/revenue/contracts.mdx` sends admins to this very table to
 *     find it (#823/#805).
 *   - **A row's TRIGGER was wrong.** `campaign_enrollment` was a Monday-9-AM
 *     schedule flow until it was rewritten as a screen flow (a cron seeds no
 *     input variables, so every run enrolled nothing or died on validation —
 *     see the header of `src/flows/campaign-enrollment.flow.ts`). All three
 *     pages still billed it as `Schedule (Mon 9 AM)`, and the prose under the
 *     table counted it among the scheduled sweeps.
 *
 * Nothing checked, because a flow name in a markdown table is prose: `os
 * validate` and `pnpm lint` walk authored metadata and never open
 * `content/docs`. So the check has to live where the claim lives — in the text.
 *
 * ## What is derived, and what is authored
 *
 * DERIVED from the compiled stack (`stack.flows`, not a count of `src/flows/*`
 * files — several of those export two flows apiece, which is how a 21-file
 * directory ships 24 flows and how a file-counting reader gets a third wrong
 * number):
 *
 *   - the ROW SET — every shipped flow has exactly one row on each of the three
 *     pages, and no row names a flow the app does not ship;
 *   - each row's TRIGGER cell — the start node's kind (screen / record change /
 *     schedule), the `record-after-create` vs `record-after-update` half for
 *     record-change flows, and the cron for scheduled ones;
 *   - both NUMERALS — the `(24)` in the table's header sentence and the "nine
 *     `Schedule` rows" in the section below it. Both are computed from the stack
 *     and never from the number of rows parsed out of the table, so the table
 *     and the prose cannot drift into agreeing with each other while both are
 *     wrong. That is the channel the `(11)` header lived in: it agreed with the
 *     eleven rows beneath it perfectly.
 *
 * AUTHORED, because it cannot be derived:
 *
 *   - the two Chinese ROW LABELS per flow ({@link ROW_LABEL}). Flows carry no
 *     entry in the locale packs — `src/translations/zh-CN.ts` translates objects,
 *     fields, views and actions, not flows — and the app ships no zh-Hant pack at
 *     all, so each Chinese page translates the flow labels itself. Same boundary,
 *     and same reason, as `sharing-coverage.test.ts`'s `ROW_LABEL` (#795/#811).
 *   - the ENGLISH row label is NOT in the ledger: the English page uses each
 *     flow's own `label` verbatim, so it is checked against the stack, which is
 *     strictly stronger than a ledger entry. That is also a product decision, not
 *     just a test convenience — the label is what **Studio → Developer → Flow
 *     Runs** lists, so a table keyed on it can be searched from a run the admin
 *     is staring at.
 *   - the cron DISPLAY text ({@link CRON_LABEL}) and the number WORDS
 *     ({@link COUNT_WORD}). An unregistered cron or count throws rather than
 *     passing silently — the convention `docs-drift.test.ts` set for its own
 *     `CRON_LABEL`.
 *
 * ## Why every flow, with no status filter
 *
 * The row set is every flow in the artifact, unfiltered. All 24 ship `status:
 * 'active'` today, so a `status` filter would be a branch nothing exercises. If a
 * `draft` flow ever ships, this guard fails until someone decides what the table
 * means — "flows this app ships" or "flows that run" — which is the right moment
 * to make that decision, and better than a filter written now on a guess about
 * which answer a future reader wants.
 *
 * `demo_bootstrap` IS in the table for the same reason, and it is not a close
 * call: that flow ships in the artifact and runs in a customer's org every ten
 * minutes, writing `owner_id` (its own header says so, and
 * `test/demo-staffing.test.ts` polices what it may write). An admin who sees
 * ownership change on a ten-minute beat needs a row to find. The page labels it
 * scaffolding rather than business automation in the prose under the table,
 * which is the honest way to say both things at once.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (four directions, each predicted before it was run)
 *
 * | direction | predicted | measured |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | put `(11)` back in the English header | only the English total-count rule reds; every row rule stays green because no row moved | `1 failed | 19 passed`: `automation.mdx (en) says 11 built-in flows; the stack ships 24` |
 * | delete the `Contact Welcome` row from zh-Hant | only that page's row rule reds, naming the flow; **both count rules stay green** — the numerals come from the stack, not from the rows | `1 failed | 19 passed`: `contact_welcome: automation.zh-Hant.mdx (zh-Hant) has no "聯絡人歡迎" row` |
 * | put the stale `计划（周一 9 点）` trigger back on the campaign row (zh-Hans), leaving the label alone | only the trigger rule reds; the schedule-count rule stays green, because it counts scheduled flows in the stack and never the rows that say `计划` | `1 failed | 19 passed`: `campaign_enrollment: … trigger cell "计划（周一 9 点）" is missing "屏幕"` |
 * | add a row for a flow the app does not ship | only the ghost-row rule reds | `1 failed | 19 passed`: `automation.mdx (en): row "Territory Rebalance" names no flow this app ships` |
 *
 * Directions 2 and 3 are the ones worth the trouble. Together they show the row
 * set, the trigger cells and the two numerals are pinned to the same derived
 * set independently — so no pair of them can drift into agreement, which is
 * exactly how a table of eleven rows kept a header reading `(11)` while the app
 * shipped 24 flows. Direction 3 makes that concrete: with the stale cell back in
 * place the zh-Hans table holds TEN rows saying `计划` while the prose under it
 * says 九个, and the count rule is still green — because it is reading the stack,
 * which is the only place either number has ever been true.

/**
 * The converted-lead lock is ONE guard, and it is the hook (#575 B1).
 *
 * `crm_lead` used to carry two: a `cannot_edit_converted` script validation
 * over the four identity fields, and the `beforeUpdate` throw in
 * `lead.hook.ts`. A code comment described the pair as a deliberate division of
 * labour — the validation for a friendly, recoverable error on identity fields,
 * the hook for a hard stop on everything else.
 *
 * That division never existed at runtime. Patching `company` on a converted
 * lead returned the HOOK's message on 16.1.0, because a `beforeUpdate` throw
 * aborts the write before validations are evaluated; the validation could not
 * produce the friendlier error it promised, on any field, ever. It was the same
 * shape as the `revenue_positive` rule deleted in #571: two implementations of
 * one rule, one of them dead and free to drift.
 *
 * So the validation is gone and these tests pin what replaced it — which is
 * nothing, deliberately. The hook has to carry the whole contract now, and its
 * message has to be good enough to be the only one a user sees.

/**
 * Record-level sharing coverage guards (#549).
 *
 * A sharing rule widens **the object it names** — never the records hanging off
 * it. HotCRM authors its widening rules on `crm_account` (territory + team),
 * but the account's children each keep their own baseline: `crm_quote`,
 * `crm_contract` and `crm_task` are `private` with no rule of their own, and
 * `crm_opportunity` only widens through the >= $100k leadership rules. A rep
 * who receives an account through a territory rule therefore opens it to
 * partially empty related lists. `crm_contact` is `controlled_by_parent`, which
 * does NOT mean "follows the account": as MEASURED by
 * `test/parent-derived-reach.test.ts`, a parent-derived child is readable
 * org-wide — see the 'derived' note on ACCOUNT_CHILD_COVERAGE below.
 *
 * Whether those children *should* follow the account is an open business
 * decision (#549) — widening any of them changes what every holder of that
 * object sees, not just the territory recipient. These tests do not take that
 * decision. They pin two things so it stays a decision instead of drift:
 *
 *   1. the coverage ledger below — the shipped answer, per account child, so a
 *      new child object (or a rule added/removed) has to update it knowingly;
 *   2. the admin docs — the prose that describes who sees what has to keep
 *      matching the metadata. The gap in #549 was reported as a *promise*
 *      problem: `content/docs/revenue/contracts.mdx` told admins "contracts
 *      follow the account's sharing" while the metadata delivered own-only.
 *
 * `test/authorization-coverage.test.ts` (#488/#547) covers the object-grant
 * half — this file is only about record-level reach.

 *                the child is not filtered to accounts the caller can READ —
 *                the ADR-0055 derivation resolves the master id set through the

 *   'partial'  — private, but a rule of its own widens SOME records (never by
 *                account criteria — the rules match on the child's own fields).
 *
 * This is the status quo, pinned deliberately. Changing an entry is the
 * business decision #549 asks for; it belongs in a PR that also updates the
 * admin docs and the sharing rules, not in a drive-by edit here.

/**
 * The OWD table IS the registered-object list — on all three locale pages
 * (#710 for the parent-derived rows, #790 for the rest of the table).
 *
 * `crm_event_attendee` shipped `controlled_by_parent` with the activity model
 * (#592) and never reached the Org-Wide Defaults table, so the section right
 * under that table went on saying "the four parent-derived objects above" while
 * the app shipped five. #710 pinned that class. Two neighbouring defects it
 * deliberately left alone (#790) proved the class was drawn too narrowly:
 * `crm_event` had no row either, and a `Competitor` row outlived the object —
 * `crm_competitor` went with the demo-only module, taking four profile grants
 * with it (`.changeset/dangling-competitor-grants.md`), while the row stayed
 * behind telling admins to look in Setup for an object that is not there.
 * Neither was parent-derived, so neither was visible to #710's guard.
 *
 * So the rule is now the whole table: **one row per registered object, no row
 * for anything else.** The table earns that reading — with `Competitor` gone and
 * `Event` added it holds exactly the 17 objects `objectstack.config.ts`
 * registers, which is what an admin uses it for.
 *
 * ## What is derived, and what is authored
 *
 * The ROW SET and each row's OWD VALUE are derived from the compiled stack: every
 * registered object must have exactly one row, that row's OWD cell must state the
 * `sharingModel` the object actually ships, and no row may name an object this
 * app does not register. The ROW LABEL per locale is authored in {@link ROW_LABEL},
 * because it cannot be derived: these pages translate object labels themselves
 * rather than reusing the app's locale packs (the zh-Hans table says 商机行项 where
 * `src/translations/zh-CN.ts` says 商机产品明细), and the app ships no zh-Hant pack
 * at all. So a new object costs one ledger line plus three doc rows — and the
 * failure names the object AND the page, which is the point.
 *
 * `sys_*` objects are excluded, on `docs-object-coverage.test.ts`'s criterion:
 * platform objects are documented by the platform, not here. Today the compiled
 * stack contains none, so the filter changes nothing; it is there so a platform
 * that starts injecting them does not turn this table into a platform manual.
 *
 * The parent named in the cell's parentheses — "(Event)", "（活动）" — is not
 * checked: which field the platform resolves as the master is an ADR-0055
 * derivation, and asserting our guess at it here would pin this repo's reading of
 * the platform rather than the app's own metadata.
 *
 * ## What replaced #710's reverse rule
 *
 * #710 had a narrower pair: parent-derived objects must have a row, and no row
 * may *claim* Controlled by Parent for anything the stack does not derive. Both
 * are now special cases and both are gone as separate rules — a row marked
 * Controlled by Parent for a `private` object fails the OWD-value check, and a
 * row for an object nobody registers fails the ghost-row check, whatever its OWD
 * cell says. The count rule below is the one thing that did NOT generalise, and
 * it stays exactly as #710 wrote it: it counts parent-derived objects because
 * that is what the sentence under the table counts.
 *
 * ## The count is pinned to the stack, not to the table
 *
 * The number word under the table is derived from the same compiled stack as the
 * rows, never from how many rows the table happens to have. That is what makes
 * this guard catch #592's defect from either side: a page cannot lose a row and
 * talk its own prose into agreeing with the loss.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (#790, #791)
 *
 * Five directions, each predicted before it was run, each measured on this tree:
 *
 *   1. Delete the new `Event` row from the zh-Hant page → predicted RED on that
 *      page's row rule only, naming `crm_event`; the count rule stays GREEN,
 *      because Event is not parent-derived. Measured, 1 failed | 28 passed:
 *      "crm_event: content/docs/administration/sharing-and-security.zh-Hant.mdx
 *      (zh-Hant) has no "活動" row".
 *   2. Put the `Competitor` row back on the English page → predicted RED on the
 *      ghost-row rule for that page only. This is the direction #710's guard
 *      could not see at all: the row is `Public Read-Only`, so nothing about it
 *      was parent-derived. Measured, 1 failed | 28 passed:
 *      "…sharing-and-security.mdx (en): row "Competitor" names no object this app
 *      registers".
 *   3. Delete a PARENT-DERIVED row (Event Attendee) from the zh-Hans page →
 *      predicted RED on that page's row rule, and GREEN on its count rule, which
 *      keeps reading 五 off the stack. Measured, 1 failed | 28 passed:
 *      "crm_event_attendee: …sharing-and-security.zh-Hans.mdx (zh-Hans) has no
 *      "活动参与者" row" — and no count failure anywhere, which is the point of
 *      direction 3: rows and the number word cannot drift into agreeing with
 *      each other while both disagree with the app.
 *   4. Delete the new `活动` row from the zh-Hans RELATED-LIST table → predicted
 *      RED on the Chinese related-list coverage rule for that page only.
 *      Measured, 1 failed | 28 passed: "…zh-Hans.mdx (zh-Hans): the related-list
 *      table has to cover every account child in the ledger … expected
 *      [ 'crm_case', 'crm_contact', …(4) ] to deeply equal

/**
 * The built-in sharing-rules table, on all three locale pages (#809).
 *
 * Layer 3's table is the admin's roster of what this app widens out of the box:
 * one row per shipped rule, naming the object it targets, the access it grants
 * and the position that receives it. Until now only the English page was held to
 * it — the two rules this block replaces read {@link SHARING_DOC} alone, which
 * is the same single-locale shape #710 closed for the OWD table and #791 for the
 * related-list table one heading further down.
 *
 * ## This had stopped being dormant by the time it was widened
 *
 * The card asking for this (#809, filed 2026-08-05) had compared both Chinese
 * tables against `src/sharing/` row by row and found them clean, and filed the
 * gap as dormant. It did not stay dormant. On 2026-08-12 commit `4a0e1de`
 * (#1096) added `case_unassigned_triage_sharing` **and** its English row —
 * `| Unassigned Cases — Triage | Case | Edit | ... |` — and never touched the
 * two Chinese pages. So widening these rules goes RED on `main`, on both Chinese
 * pages, naming the rule they are missing.
 *
 * That red is the defect, not a fault in the guard, and it is the exact
 * mechanism the card predicted one week before it fired: the English page is
 * *forced* correct, the other two are merely watched by nobody. What the two
 * pages are currently hiding is the app's only grant over records with **no
 * owner at all** — `service_agent` gets EDIT on every open, unowned case. The
 * two rows belong to the docs PR that follows this one; a docs correction riding
 * along in here would make the guard and the correction unreviewable together.
 *
 * ## What is derived, and what is authored
 *
 * The ROW SET and every fact a row states are DERIVED from the compiled stack:
 * the roster is `sharingRules` itself, the object cell must name the object the
 * rule really targets, the Grants cell its real `accessLevel`, the To cell its
 * real position. No fact about a rule is written down twice — adding or removing
 * a sharing rule costs **zero** edits to any ledger here and three doc rows,
 * which is the entire point of the block.
 *
 * Only the LANGUAGE is authored, each word exactly once:
 *
 *   - the object column reads {@link ROW_LABEL} on the Chinese pages — the same
 *     ledger the OWD and related-list rules already read — and the stack's own
 *     `label` on the English page, which is a derivation and so needs no entry;
 *   - the Grants column needs {@link ACCESS_WORD}: three locales x two access
 *     levels, the one genuinely new thing this card adds;
 *   - the rule name and the position name are language-invariant (the Chinese
 *     tables carry the English rule labels verbatim, and the position sits in
 *     backticks), so both are compared directly against the stack, no ledger.
 *
 * That shape is deliberate about #549, which sits in the maintainer's inbox
 * proposing to convert `crm_contract` to `controlled_by_parent`. A
 * classification change moves {@link ACCOUNT_CHILD_COVERAGE} — one entry, one
 * place — and nothing in this block has to move with it, because no per-object,
 * per-locale fact about classification is copied in here. Closing a card about
 * three tables drifting apart by adding three more locale-shaped copies would be
 * a strange way to close it.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (#809)
 *
 * Recorded with the measured output in the PR body. Two of the four directions
 * needed no mutation at all: the roster rule is already red on `main` for both
 * Chinese pages, which is the drift above.

/**
 * The Chinese pages describe the same account children as the English one (#791).

 * model landed (#592) — stayed missing from both Chinese tables: nothing was
 * looking. Same shape as the OWD gap #710 closed, one table further down.
 *
 * Why this covers the two Chinese pages and not all three: the English rule
 * resolves its rows against `pluralLabel` **derived from the stack**, which is
 * strictly stronger than a ledger and needs no entry here. The Chinese pages
 * cannot be checked that way — the app ships no zh-Hant locale pack, and the
 * zh-Hans doc translates independently of the one it does ship — so they are
 * checked against {@link ROW_LABEL}, which they reuse verbatim because Chinese
 * has no plural form. Two rules, one per kind of page, rather than one rule
 * weakened to the worse of the two.
 *
 * The verdict predicates are the English rule's, transposed per locale: a row
 * may not promise the child follows the account unless the ledger says
 * 'derived', may not say own-only about a parent-derived child, and must name a
 * position for every extra record it promises. Deliberately NOT extended here:
 * the built-in sharing-rules table (its object and access-level columns are
 * translated too, and no drift is reported there today) — filed as a finding

/**
 * The profiles page states that same reach, in every locale (#807).
 *
 * Exactly the defect above, one page over. `profiles.mdx` describes the same
 * derivation from the persona's side — what a Sales Representative reaches on
 * Contact and on the two line-item objects — and PR #699 rewrote those two
 * bullets in English only. The two Chinese pages went on promising the
 * pre-#699 reading for six weeks ("**联系人** 跟随客户", "对自己的交易和报价拥有完整
 * 权限"), which is not merely stale but the reverse of what ships: a rep reading
 * one account reads both accounts' contacts, and a rep reading NO quote still
 * reads every quote's lines (`test/parent-derived-reach.test.ts`).
 *
 * Nothing was red. The reach guard above stops at `sharing-and-security`, the
 * OWD and related-list rules read tables this page does not have, and
 * `docs-locale-callouts.test.ts` compares callout counts, which #699 did not
 * change —
 * `grep -rn "profiles.mdx" test/` was empty before this block.
 *
 * ## Why a second ledger rather than a fourth entry in PAGES
 *
 * {@link PAGES} describes pages built out of the OWD and related-list TABLES;
 * every field on it (`owdHeading`, `owdCell`, `countSentence`,
 * `relatedListHeading`) is meaningless here, because this page carries the claim
 * in a bullet list under a persona heading. So this block reuses the parsing
 * infrastructure — {@link DOC}, {@link bulletsAfter}, an authored-per-locale
 * RegExp ledger, the same anti-vacuum discipline — and not the row shape.
 *
 * ## What is derived, and what is authored
 *
 * The CLAIM WORDING is authored per locale in {@link PROFILE_PAGES}: no locale's
 * prose is derivable, and — same reason as the reach guard above — the app ships
 * no zh-Hant pack and the zh-Hans page translates independently of the one it
 * does ship. What is DERIVED is the precondition these three bullets rest on:
 * the objects they describe must still be registered and still ship
 * `controlled_by_parent`. That is what keeps the authored regexes answerable to
 * the app: the day Contact stops being parent-derived, this block goes red on
 * the derived rule and the wording has to be re-taken rather than re-matched.
 *
 * Like the guard above, what the claim rules pin is CO-MOVEMENT, not truth. The
 * truth is measured in `test/parent-derived-reach.test.ts`. The English page is
 * checked here too, deliberately: it is the baseline the Chinese pages were
 * brought to, so if a future rewrite moves it and leaves them behind, the
 * English rule is the one that fires first and names the page.
 *
 * The pointer is checked per locale rather than as a language-neutral token: on
 * this page it is a cross-reference to *Controlled by Parent, in practice* on
 * the sharing page (that is the form the English page uses — the upstream issue
 * number lives on the page that pointer lands on), and both the localized route
 * prefix and the translated section title differ per locale.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (#807)
 *
 * Five directions, each predicted before it was run, each measured on this tree:
 *
 *   1. Put the pre-#699 promise back on the zh-Hans page ("**联系人** 跟随客户：
 *      代表能看到自己可见的每个客户下的联系人") → predicted RED on that page's claim
 *      rule ONLY: no table row moved, so nothing above can see it, and that is
 *      the whole reason this block exists. Measured, 1 failed | 35 passed — and
 *      that one test reported THREE findings, not one, because the pre-#699
 *      bullet carried no cross-reference either: "no bullet matching
 *      /组织内的每一个联系人 —— 而不只是代表能看到的那些客户下面的/", "does not point at
 *      /zh-Hans/docs/administration/sharing-and-security", "does not point at
 *      *“由父级控制”在实践中*". Losing the claim and losing the pointer to what
 *      explains it are the same regression here, which is why they are one rule.
 *   2. Put the narrowed line-item promise back on the zh-Hant page ("對自己的交易
 *      和報價擁有完整權限") → predicted RED on that page's claim rule only, naming
 *      the line-item regex and leaving the contact one green. Measured,
 *      1 failed | 35 passed: "profiles.zh-Hant.mdx (zh-Hant): no bullet matching
 *      /每一筆交易、每一張報價的明細，而不只是代表自己的/".
 *   3. Break the ENGLISH bullet (drop "not only those on accounts the rep can
 *      see") → predicted RED on the English page's claim rule, proving this
 *      block watches the baseline too and does not merely compare the two
 *      Chinese pages to each other. Measured, 1 failed | 35 passed:
 *      "profiles.mdx (en): no bullet matching /every contact in the org — not
 *      only those on accounts the rep can see/".
 *   4. Rename the zh-Hans persona heading (`### 💼 Sales Representative` →
 *      `### 💼 Sales Rep`) → predicted RED TWICE on that page and nowhere else:
 *      the parse rule and the claim rule both read the block through
 *      {@link bulletsAfter}, so a section that moved fails as a missing heading
 *      rather than as an empty list every rule passes over. Measured,
 *      2 failed | 34 passed, both "…"### 💼 Sales Representative" is gone from
 *      content/docs/administration/profiles.zh-Hans.mdx — this guard has gone
 *      blind".
 *   5. Typo one name in {@link PARENT_DERIVED_IN_PROFILES}
 *      (`crm_quote_line_item` → `crm_quote_lineitem`) → predicted RED on the
 *      derived precondition, naming it as unregistered. This is the anti-vacuum:
 *      it proves that rule reads the compiled stack instead of comparing an
 *      authored list to itself. Measured, 1 failed | 35 passed:
 *      "crm_quote_lineitem: not an object this app registers".

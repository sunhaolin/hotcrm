/**
 * `scripts/check-source-token-ratchet.mjs` (#1183).
 *
 * The gate puts a shrink-only ceiling on HotCRM's headline positioning claim —
 * the authored surface, in estimated tokens. Two things about it can rot
 * silently, and this suite pins both.
 *
 * **The measurement basis.** The number is only meaningful if the same rule is
 * applied on every run, so the stripping rule is asserted here rather than
 * described only in prose: comments go, string bodies stay, and the two
 * excluded trees (`src/translations/`, `src/data/`) are never measured at all.
 * That last one is a maintainer ruling, not an implementation detail
 * (「translations + seed 肯定是不需要算 token 的」) — a well-meaning "surely
 * translations count too" edit must fail a test, not merely surprise a reader.
 *
 * **The wiring.** #1169 is a live example in this repo of a workflow whose
 * triggers never fire for the files it checks — a gate that cannot run is
 * indistinguishable from a gate that passes. The `wiring` block below asserts
 * the script is actually invoked by both workflows and by `pnpm verify`, and
 * that the workflow carrying it has no `paths:` filter that could keep it from
 * firing on the very tree it measures.
 *
 * Mechanics: the script derives its repo root from its own location
 * (`new URL('..', import.meta.url)`), so copying it into `<sandbox>/scripts/`
 * makes a throwaway directory its root — the same technique
 * `source-hygiene-scan-surface.test.ts` uses. That runs the real, unmodified
 * gate, with its real committed ceilings, against fixtures we control. The
 * script imports nothing outside `node:` builtins and its own
 * `scripts/lib/main-module.mjs` (copied alongside it by `beforeEach`), so the
 * sandbox needs no `node_modules`.
 *
 * That sandbox lives under `mkdtempSync(tmpdir())`, which on macOS is
 * `/var/folders/…` — and `/var` is a symlink to `/private/var`. Until #1252 the
 * gate's own run-when-main guard compared `import.meta.url` (the realpath)
 * against `pathToFileURL(process.argv[1])` (the path as spelled), so every case
 * below spawned a gate that never called `main()`, printed zero bytes and
 * exited 0 — ten of the fifteen failing as `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON
 * input` on any macOS checkout, and none of them on Linux CI where `/tmp` is a
 * real directory. The guard now canonicalises both sides; `script-main-guard.test.ts`
 * holds the whole class of scripts to it.
 *
 * ## The stripper's equivalence proof is a hand run, recorded here
 *
 * `stripComments()` is a hand-written character scanner (TypeScript 7's npm
 * package exposes no compiler API — `import ts from 'typescript'` yields
 * `{ version, versionMajorMinor }` and nothing else — so there is no scanner to
 * borrow). Its correctness over the *whole real tree* was proved by hand with
 * esbuild, which the ObjectStack CLI already builds with:
 *
 *   for every first-party .ts file f (src, test, e2e, scripts — 286 files):
 *     esbuild.transform(f, { loader: 'ts', minify: true }).code
 *       === esbuild.transform(stripComments(f), { loader: 'ts', minify: true }).code
 *
 *   -> 286 files, 0 divergent, 0 line-count drifts, 1,495,852 chars removed
 *
 * Byte-identical minified output means the strip removed comments and nothing
 * else — no string, regex or code byte moved. That run is in the PR body. It is
 * not automated here because `esbuild` is not a declared dependency of this
 * repo (it arrives under the ObjectStack CLI), and a test that fails when an
 * undeclared package is laid out differently would be reporting on pnpm, not on
 * this gate. The hazard classes it covers are pinned as fixtures below instead.

 * The header's worked table — the second hand-calibrated copy of the ceilings,

 * the ceiling, `CEILINGS` holds what was committed, and the headroom and
 * percentage fall out of the two. The table restates all of it in prose beside
 * the constants, so it rots the moment one moves — which is exactly what #1317
 * found when it re-anchored the interaction layer and the row went false.
 *
 * Since #1601 the table carries TWO shapes, because a ceiling can now be
 * reached two ways. An ANCHORED row shows its arithmetic — `anchor()` of a
 * reading this gate printed — and every case below still holds it to that. A
 * RULED row is a maintainer grant: no reading derives it, so there is no
 * arithmetic to show and the row states the constant and the date it was ruled.
 * Both kinds are pinned and neither may go missing. The kind is not a free
 * choice either: the ruled case checks that no reading recorded here could have
 * anchored the constant, which is what stops a ceiling being filed as "ruled"
 * to dodge arithmetic that did in fact apply.
 *
 * ⚠️ `headroom` on a row is the headroom **at anchor time** — that row's own
 * reading against its own ceiling — and is deliberately NOT what the gate prints
 * today: the tree keeps moving between re-anchorings, and since #1320 the three
 * rows do not even come from one run (hence the per-row date column). So every
 * assertion here is internal to the row plus the committed constant, and none of
 * them reads a live measurement. Comparing a row's headroom against a live run
 * would be wrong by design, not merely flaky.

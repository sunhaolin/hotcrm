/**
 * The quick-tour page's left-nav table, pinned to `src/apps/crm.app.ts` (#960).
 *
 * This is the first table a new user reads, and its entire job is "here is what
 * the sidebar holds". Every one of its eight rows had drifted: four named
 * groups the app does not have (*Products*, *Activities*, *Analytics*, *AI*),
 * three real groups were absent entirely (**My Work**, **Activity**,
 * **Insights**), and the four rows whose group did exist each dropped items or
 * spelled a label the app never shows (*Knowledge Base* for **Knowledge**,
 * *Campaign Members* / *Approval Requests* / *Action History* for items that
 * exist nowhere).
 *
 * Nothing caught it: `os validate` and `pnpm lint` walk authored metadata and
 * never open `content/docs`, so — as with the service-index guard in
 * `docs-service-index-analytics.test.ts` (#948) — the check has to live where
 * the claim lives. Prose that enumerates an IA goes stale the first time the IA
 * moves, which is exactly what happened here.
 *
 * The rules below are two-directional, and the page's typography carries the
 * distinction:
 *
 *  - **bold** is reserved for names the app really carries. Every bold Latin run
 *    in the section must resolve to a navigation label or to the dashboard the
 *    pinned Home entry opens. (Bold runs containing CJK are the locale prose's
 *    own emphasis and are skipped — product names stay English in every locale,
 *    the same convention `docs-dashboard-tiles.test.ts` leans on.)
 *  - *italic* is reserved for a name the product does NOT carry, the spelling
 *    #927 / PR #932 established. Every retired name must still be named in
 *    italics — the convention is to say where a reader's name really lives, not
 *    to delete it silently — and no phantom may ever appear in bold.
 *  - exists ⇒ listed: the table's rows are compared against `CrmApp.navigation`
 *    group-for-group, child-for-child, in source order. Add a nav item without
 *    touching the tour and this file goes red at PR time, in all three locales.
 *
 * ## The app's own name is part of the assertion set (#998)
 *
 * The rules above pinned every name INSIDE the app and left the app's name
 * itself unguarded, and that is exactly where the next drift landed: 22 doc
 * pages called this app *Enterprise CRM*, a spelling `src/` has never carried
 * anywhere — `CrmApp.label`, all four locale bundles, the build artifact and the
 * marketplace manifest all say **HotCRM**. It looks like a hand-rearranged
 * reading of the identifier `crm_enterprise`. The name even survived a full
 * round of navigation rewrites (#927 / #938 / #943 / #963 / #976) because it was
 * never the thing under review.
 *
 * This file could not see it twice over: the guarded block STARTED at the line
 * naming the app, so the app-launcher list one paragraph above it was outside
 * every rule, and the occurrence inside the block was not bold, so the
 * "bold must be a real name" rule passed over it.
 *
 * Both holes are closed by deriving the app's name from `CrmApp.label` rather
 * than writing it down here:
 *
 *  - the block's `start` marker is built from the label, so renaming the app in
 *    `src/` fails as "block start not found" until the pages are re-taken;
 *  - each page's app-launcher bullet ({@link PAGES}`.launcher`) must name the
 *    app by exactly `CrmApp.label`;
 *  - the label joins {@link ALLOWED_BOLD}, so the page may bold it like any
 *    other real name.

/* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Section 1 — the landing dashboard (#971)
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/**
 * The quick tour's opening section, pinned to the dashboard **Home** really
 * opens (#971).
 *
 * The section described a dashboard that does not exist. Its name came from
 * `crm_overview_dashboard` — a real dashboard, but the one under **Insights**,
 * a group that is collapsed on load, so a new user neither lands on it nor can
 * click it without opening the group first. Its five bullets came from three
 * different dashboards: exactly one, **Open Leads**, is a tile on the dashboard
 * `nav_home` actually binds.
 *
 * The rewrite is measured against `ExecutiveDashboard.widgets` at runtime, not
 * against the file's text, and that distinction is the whole reason the issue
 * mis-counted. #971 read the source and listed EIGHT tiles, concluding that no
 * pipeline tile existed on this dashboard — but the funnel arrives from the
 * shared factory (`pipelineByStageFunnelWidget`, #539), so it carries no inline
 * `title:` literal to grep. The dashboard ships NINE tiles, and **Pipeline by
 * Stage** is one of them; the four locale bundles register it too. So the
 * page's "opportunities in your pipeline" bullet was the one claim that was
 * half-right, and the rewrite says what the tile really measures — open
 * opportunity VALUE per stage, not a count of deals. A count tile does exist,
 * **Active Deals**, and it is on **CRM Overview**.
 *
 * Rules, in both directions, using the typography section 2 already
 * establishes (#960 / PR #968):
 *
 *  - exists ⇒ listed: every widget title on `executive_dashboard` must appear
 *    in the section, so a new tile cannot land while the tour goes stale.
 *  - listed ⇒ exists: every bolded Latin run must resolve to a real widget
 *    title, dashboard label, navigation label, dashboard filter label, or the
 *    permission set the section names. (CJK bold runs are the locale prose's
 *    own emphasis — product names stay English in every locale.)
 *  - a name the reader arrives with is re-pointed, never deleted: the four
 *    retired claims must each still be named, in *italics*, and none may ever
 *    be bolded as if it were real.
 *  - the source side of the negative claims is pinned too. Bind a case or an
 *    activity dataset to either landing-candidate dashboard, add a per-account
 *    ranking, give positions a parent, or take `viewAllRecords` off the sales
 *    manager, and this file goes red — because the prose would then be wrong in
 *    the other direction.

/**
 * Runtime-coverage guard.
 *
 * The gap this closes is the one that let 20 of 24 hooks and 17 of 20 flows
 * ship with no runtime test at all: nothing anywhere failed when a new hook or
 * flow arrived untested. `os validate` proves a hook is WIRED; the
 * metadata-contract suites prove it is SHAPED correctly; only a runtime test
 * proves it BEHAVES.
 *
 * Line coverage cannot enforce this on its own. A flow file is an object
 * literal, so importing it scores 100% whether or not any test ever executes
 * the flow — which is exactly why `vitest.config.ts` scopes v8 coverage to the
 * hook handlers and defers flow coverage to this structural check.
 *
 * The rule: every registered hook name and every registered flow name must
 * appear somewhere in a runtime test file. That is a deliberately low bar —
 * naming a flow is not the same as testing it well — but it is a bar that
 * cannot be cleared by accident, and it makes a new untested hook or flow fail
 * CI on the PR that adds it.

  // does either side of the hook (the transfer gate refusing a hand-written

  // deliberate non-refusals (`log_call`, a completed Call task, a held Call
  // event) that draw the line between preventing a call and hiding one. Both

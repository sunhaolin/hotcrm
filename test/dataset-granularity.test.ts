/**
 * Date-bucket guard for the analytics semantic layer (#523).
 *
 * Matrix reports over a date axis need the dataset dimension to declare a
 * `dateGranularity` — that is the only supported place to say "bucket this by
 * month". The v9 single-form migration dropped the old
 * `groupingsAcross[].dateGranularity` declarations and nothing carried them to
 * the new location, so for the whole 16.x line every date axis grouped by the
 * raw timestamp — one column per distinct value.
 *
 * That migration is FINISHED. All six entries in `INTENDED_BUCKET` below are
 * declared on their dataset dimensions under `src/datasets/`, and this guard
 * runs its 17+ face asserting exactly that. Nothing here waits on the platform.
 *
 * Why it waited — history, not a live constraint. On @objectstack 16.x a
 * bucketed dimension made the surface render EMPTY, strictly worse than the
 * un-bucketed columns, for two independent reasons. Both are fixed and
 * RELEASED; each was re-verified against the version heading it sits under in
 * the INSTALLED package CHANGELOG, and nothing between that heading and the
 * pinned 17.3.0 reverts it:
 *
 *   1. A granular dimension is refused by NativeSQLStrategy — still true — so
 *      the query falls to ObjectQLStrategy → the auto-bridged
 *      `executeAggregate`. On 16.x that bridge called `engine.aggregate()`
 *      with no ExecutionContext, and the sharing middleware then composed
 *      `{ id: '__deny_all__' }` for every private object (upstream
 *      #3602/#3597). Fixed in `@objectstack/service-analytics` under its
 *      `17.0.0-rc.0` heading, republished under `17.0.0` GA: the bridge now
 *      forwards the caller's ExecutionContext and ObjectQLStrategy enforces
 *      the read scope itself. 17.1–17.3 only ADD read-scope doors.
 *   2. A `Field.datetime()` column was INTEGER epoch millis in SQLite and 16.x
 *      bucketed it with a bare `strftime()`, which returned NULL for every
 *      row. Fixed by the one-UTC-storage-form change (upstream #3912/#3942) in
 *      `@objectstack/driver-sql` under `17.0.0-rc.1`, republished under
 *      `17.0.0` GA and carried into `@objectstack/driver-sqlite-wasm` as a
 *      dependency update: SQLite stores ISO text, which `strftime` parses, so
 *      the bucket expression needs no CASE. Same pair the
 *      `event_metrics.start_datetime` note below records as released.
 *
 * So this guard has two faces, and the platform major flips between them:
 *
 *   · on 16.x — assert NOBODY re-declares a bucket (the #500 regression), and
 *     keep the intended buckets recorded below so they are not lost again;
 *   · on 17+  — assert every intended bucket IS declared, and that each matrix
 *     report's date axis carries the bucket that report is named after. This
 *     is the face that runs today, and it went green when the migration was
 *     finished.
 *
 * The 16.x face stays. It is what makes the tables a migration RECORD rather
 * than a second copy of the metadata, and it is what would catch a downgrade.
 *
 * The tables below are the migration's source of truth. Keep them in sync with
 * the surfaces, not with the current platform version.

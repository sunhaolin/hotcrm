/*
 * ─── Product docs count the metadata the stack registers (#729) ──────────────
 *
 * The README banner, the "What you get" section, the fork guide and the docs
 * overview all state how many objects / flows / dashboards / datasets HotCRM
 * ships. Every one of those numbers was written by hand and then left behind:
 * #592 added `crm_event` and `crm_event_attendee` plus a fifth dashboard, and
 * the docs still advertised 15 objects / 23 flows / 4 dashboards two releases
 * later. The README banner is the first thing a reader sees, and the fork guide
 * is what a customer follows — being told the wrong inventory there is a product
 * defect, not a typo.
 *
 * The expected values are read from `objectstack.config.ts` at test time and are
 * deliberately NOT written down here. A hard-coded expectation is just the same
 * hand-maintained number moved into the test file: it would go stale on the very
 * next object and take the guard with it.
 *
 * `actions` was deliberately absent while the calibre was undecided: the docs
 * said 13, the registered stack said 26, and the two count different things — an
 * action bound to five objects registers five times (#729's closing note).
 * #1012 settled it — the count a reader is told is the REGISTRATION count, for
 * the two reasons that decided it: every other figure in the same README
 * sentence is already a registration count, and it is the only calibre this rule
 * can re-derive instead of asserting a hand-maintained number back at itself
 * (a "family" is not a countable entity anywhere in `src/`). So `actions` now
 * reads off the stack like every other kind here.
 *
 * Its CLAIMS pattern is bold-scoped (`**26 actions**`) where the others are not,
 * and that is not decoration: `actions` is the one noun on this list that is
 * also an ordinary English word in these pages. `content/docs/whats-new.mdx`
 * quotes a Copilot prompt — "What are the next 3 actions I should take?" — in
 * all three locales, and a bare `(\d+) actions` reads that sentence as an
 * inventory claim and demands it say 26. The inventory sentence bolds every
 * figure it states, so the bold is what separates a claim about the app from a
 * sentence that merely contains a number. (Those quotes sit under the v1.0
 * heading HISTORICAL exempts, so today they would be excused anyway — that is an
 * accident of where the example lives, not a reason to write a pattern that
 * matches the wrong sentence.)
 *
 * Reverse verification: predicted and measured **red before, green after**. On
 * the pre-fix tree the rule listed nine drifted claims across seven files
 * (README ×5, fork-hotcrm ×3 locales, index ×3 locales, introduction ×3
 * locales); after the fix the only surviving `15` is the exempt v1.0 record.

   * SECTIONS allowed to state a count that is not today's, each with the reason.
   * A map rather than a list, for the reason the persona rule gives in
   * `docs-retired-personas.test.ts`: an exemption with no stated reason is how
   * a targeted whitelist becomes a blanket one. All three entries are the same page in its three locales, and
   * the reason is the same one that exempts it from the persona rule — it is a
   * dated release record describing what v1.0 shipped, not a claim about today.
   *
   * ## Why the key is a SECTION and not a file (#1015)
   *
   * It was a file. `content/docs/whats-new.mdx` carries the v1.0 record AND a
   * "Latest release" section, which is a claim about TODAY — and a page-wide
   * exemption granted for the first covered the second. Under it that section
   * advertised `v5.0` / "Upgraded to ObjectStack 5.0" for however long it took
   * someone to read the page: neither number was ever an app version (the
   * manifest says 2.2.2) or the installed platform (17.0.0-rc.3), and the one
   * rule that would have noticed had been told not to look. The exemption was
   * right about the v1.0 section and wrong about the page.
   *
   * A claim is now exempt only when the `## ` section it sits under matches the
   * pattern here. The v1.0 heading opens with `v1.0` in all three locales, so
   * one pattern covers them; anything else on the page is checked like any
   * other product page.

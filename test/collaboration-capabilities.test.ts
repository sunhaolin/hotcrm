/**
 * Collaboration-capability guards (#602) — `enable.files` and `enable.feeds`.
 *
 * Both flags are live in @objectstack 17 and enforced on BOTH sides, which is
 * what makes them worth pinning here rather than trusting a comment:
 *
 * - `files` (opt-in, spec default `false`): `plugin-audit`'s
 *   `enforceFilesCapability` rejects a `sys_attachment` insert whose
 *   `parent_object` does not declare `files: true` with 403 `FILES_DISABLED`,
 *   and the console renders the record Attachments panel only when the flag is
 *   `true`. Verified in the browser against a live dev stack: attaching to
 *   `crm_lead` (flag absent) answers
 *   `FILES_DISABLED — File attachments are not enabled for object 'crm_lead'`.
 * - `feeds` (opt-OUT, spec default `true`): the same plugin rejects
 *   `sys_comment` inserts only for an explicit `feeds: false`, and the console
 *   hides the record feed only on explicit `false`.
 *
 * The asymmetry is the whole point of these tests. `files: true` is a real
 * change in behaviour; `feeds: true` is a restatement of the default that
 * changes nothing, so this app authors the first and refuses the second —
 * inert metadata reads as load-bearing to the next author (and to the next
 * model), which is exactly how a "capability" nobody enforces gets shipped.
 *
 * The authorization half is the platform's, not this app's: attaching requires
 * `canEdit(parent)`, reads are intersected with the parents the caller can see,
 * and deletes require uploader-or-parent-editor (service-storage attachment
 * hooks + ADR-0104 governed download). No permission set here grants
 * `sys_attachment`, and none needs to — see the canonical note in
 * `src/objects/index.ts`. What this file pins is the app-side half: the flag is
 * only on where a real persona can actually use it, and never where the guest
 * set could reach it.

/**
 * Adoption pin for the platform's per-run summary (objectstack#4354).
 *
 * The gap this app recorded was that a sweep which selects records and acts on
 * none is indistinguishable from a sweep with nothing to do: both report
 * `success: true`, both write nothing, both stay green forever. That is how
 * `opportunity_stagnation`, `contract_renewal` and `campaign_enrollment` all
 * ran while doing nothing at all, and nothing in production noticed.
 *
 * The platform now answers it: every terminal run carries a `summary` of what
 * the run actually DID — `selected` / `acted` / `skipped`, plus a per-node fold
 * and the gates that closed. `sys_automation_run` persists the same numbers as
 * real columns, so an operator can filter and alert on them.
 *
 * These tests exist because the adoption is otherwise invisible. Nothing in
 * this app calls the summary, so if a platform bump stopped populating it, the
 * app would go back to having no production signal — silently, which is the
 * exact failure mode the whole thread is about. The runtime tests were what
 * caught the original defect; this is the same defence pointed at the fix.
 *
 * ⛔ Note what is deliberately NOT here: an app-side counter built from
 * `assignment` + `decision` + `notify`. That route was rejected — a
 * silent-no-op detector assembled from the primitives that just proved able to
 * fail silently has the failure mode it is meant to catch — and the rejection
 * is permanent now that the platform ships the measurement for every flow.

 * UTC calendar throughout — `setUTCDate`, not `setDate`. Mixing local-calendar

/**
 * The SaaS / multi-org composition (#1361).
 *
 * `HOTCRM_COMPOSITION=saas` assembles the shape a multi-org operator deploys on
 * the enterprise runtime under a walled tenancy posture. Three registrations
 * differ from the community app and nothing else does — `data`, `flows`, and
 * the admin persona, which is ONE change spanning `permissions` and
 * `positions` because a set and its same-named position are how this app binds
 * the two. These tests pin BOTH directions, because the two failure modes are
 * opposite and equally bad:
 *
 *  - the SaaS shape quietly keeping something (a tenant receives another
 *    company's pipeline, or a demo sweep that crosses the wall), and
 *  - the community shape quietly losing something (this card's one hard
 *    boundary is that the default composition is behaviourally unchanged).
 *
 * The last block is not an assertion about the app at all — it MEASURES, on a
 * real engine under a walled posture, why `demo_bootstrap` is excluded. A
 * comment claiming "this would cross the wall" is a story; a failing engine is
 * evidence, and if the platform ever stops behaving that way this block goes
 * red and the exclusion can be revisited on measurement rather than on memory.

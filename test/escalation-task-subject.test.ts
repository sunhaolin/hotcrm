/**
 * The escalation follow-up task is titled with the CASE NUMBER, not the record
 * id (#1208).
 *
 * The task used to be subjected `Escalated case ${caseId} needs attention`, so
 * a demo org with nine seeded escalations opened **All Tasks** on nine urgent
 * rows differing only in a 16-character opaque key — indistinguishable to the
 * agent who has to work them, and unmatchable against anything else in the UI,
 * because every case surface in this app (record pages, list views,
 * breadcrumbs, `crm_case.display_title`) names a case `CASE-00039`.
 *
 * Two things make this worth a file of its own rather than another assertion
 * in `hooks-runtime-service.test.ts`:
 *
 *  1. **It runs the LOWERED body, not the handler closure.** Hook bodies ship
 *     body-only through QuickJS. A shared helper for composing the title would
 *     make `extractHookBody` throw, the CLI build would CATCH that and bundle
 *     the closure instead, and no gate would go red — the app would just stop
 *     shipping this hook as metadata. `runHookBody` executes what the artifact
 *     actually carries, so a title composed out of module scope fails here.
 *     (The repo-wide "every registered hook still lowers to a metadata-only
 *     body" sweep in `action-sandbox.test.ts` guards the property; this guards
 *     the behaviour that depends on it.)
 *  2. **The 255-character cap is load-bearing, and only a real engine can say
 *     so.** `crm_task.subject` declares `maxLength: 255` and the engine
 *     ENFORCES it; `crm_case.subject` allows the same 255. An uncapped
 *     `工单已升级：` + number + separator + subject is therefore up to 274
 *     characters, and this hook is `async: true` + `onError: 'log'` — the
 *     rejected insert would surface nowhere and the escalation task would
 *     simply never exist. The last test below drives both halves through a
 *     real ObjectQL on the shipped `crm_task` metadata.

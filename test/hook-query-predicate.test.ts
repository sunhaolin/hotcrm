/**
 * The predicate key on `ctx.api` reads is `where`. This file is the proof.
 *
 * Every other hook test in this repo runs against `test/helpers/hook-harness.ts`
 * — a hand-written stand-in. A stand-in can only disprove what it models, and
 * this one used to accept `filter` as a synonym for `where`, so a whole class
 * of "reads the wrong record" bugs was invisible: the suite was green while
 * eight hooks queried by a key that kernel dropped on the floor.
 *
 * So these tests do NOT use the harness for the kernel claims. They stand up a
 * real ObjectQL engine on the in-memory driver and query it through a real
 * `ScopedContext` — which is literally the object the kernel injects as
 * `ctx.api` (see `ObjectQL.buildHookApi`). What passes here is what happens in
 * production.
 *
 * ⚠️ Read the two paragraphs above as HISTORY, and every claim below as a
 * measurement of the CURRENTLY PINNED engine. That distinction is the whole
 * point of #1229: the kernel that dropped `filter` on the floor is not the one
 * this repo pins, and prose written against the old one survived, confident and
 * specific, into three places that then disagreed with each other. A behaviour
 * claim about the engine belongs here, as an executing assertion, and anywhere
 * it is restated in prose it is restated as "measured, and pinned there".

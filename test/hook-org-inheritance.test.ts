/**
 * Records this app's HOOKS create inherit the triggering caller's organization
 * (#1361), on a walled deployment.
 *
 * ### Why this needed measuring rather than reasoning
 *
 * Not one of these inserts names an organization. `case.hook.ts` writes an
 * escalation `crm_task`, `quote.hook.ts` drafts a `crm_contract`,
 * `task.hook.ts` clones the next occurrence of a recurring task and
 * `lead.hook.ts` opens a follow-up — all of them through `ctx.api`, all of them
 * relying on the engine to stamp `organization_id` from the execution context
 * they inherit. Under a single-org install that column is NULL and nothing can
 * go wrong; under a wall it decides which tenant owns the row, and a row born
 * outside every partition is invisible to the tenant whose work produced it.
 *
 * Three properties of the platform make the answer non-obvious enough to
 * measure instead of assume:
 *
 *  - **The stamp comes from the context, not the payload.** `buildHookApi`
 *    hands a hook a `ScopedContext` over the SAME execution context the write
 *    ran under, so the tenant id travels only as long as that object does.
 *  - **Three of these four hooks are `async: true`.** An after-event async hook
 *    is dispatched fire-and-forget — the triggering write returns before the
 *    handler runs. Context that lived in ambient storage rather than on the
 *    context object would not survive that boundary.
 *  - **A system context is genuinely unwalled**, and it is one `isSystem` away.
 *    `test/saas-composition.test.ts` measures that direction; this file
 *    measures that ordinary hook writes are NOT on it.
 *
 * ### Why a real engine on a real driver
 *
 * `test/helpers/hook-harness.ts` implements `ctx.api` over plain arrays. It can
 * prove what a hook WRITES; it cannot prove what the engine STAMPS, because it
 * has no tenant column and no driver — a hook could be leaking rows across the
 * wall and every harness-based test in this repo would stay green. So this file
 * stands up ObjectQL on `SqliteWasmDriver` and reads `organization_id` back out
 * of SQL.
 *
 * `driver-memory` is not an option and the refusal is the platform's, not a
 * preference: it "has NO row-level tenant isolation" and fails at construction
 * under any walled posture (objectstack#6915). A suite that reached for it
 * would either not start or measure nothing.
 *
 * ### What `OS_TENANCY_POSTURE` is doing here — and what it is NOT
 *
 * It is set because that is what a walled deployment sets, and because it is
 * what makes the engine's own registry organization-scoped. It is NOT the lever
 * this file measures, and saying otherwise would be a story rather than a fact:
 * flipping it to `single` and re-running was measured, and every assertion below
 * still passes.
 *
 * That is not a hole, it is the finding stated precisely. The organization
 * predicate is the DRIVER's, compiled from the execution context's tenant id,
 * beneath permissions and sharing and independent of the posture knob — which
 * is exactly why hook writes inherit it: they run on the context the triggering
 * write ran on. The property holds wherever a context carries a tenant, and a
 * posture-conditional pin would have claimed something narrower and weaker.
 *
 * ### The sentinel, and the proof these assertions can fail
 *
 * "Every row carried org_a" is worth nothing if the probe could not have
 * surfaced a row from anywhere else. The first test plants a second tenant and
 * proves the wall is up before any silence below is allowed to mean anything.
 *
 * The other direction was measured too: making `case.hook.ts` write
 * `organization_id: 'org_b'` on its escalation task turns the first assertion
 * below red (`expected 'org_b' to be 'org_a'`). Worth recording, because a
 * hook's forged organization is NOT overwritten the way a forged value on the
 * HTTP data plane is — `ctx.api` is trusted server-side code, so this pin is
 * the thing standing between an authoring slip and a cross-tenant row.

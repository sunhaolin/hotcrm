/**
 * ═══ Ownership has exactly ONE writer, and the Claim button is not it ═══════
 *
 * The guard the #1144 ruling asked to ship WITH the feature (decision batch
 * #21, 2026-09-03): **the claim flow's payload never carries `owner_id`**, so
 * "one writer" is enforced rather than intended.
 *
 * ## Why this is worth a guard at all, when the platform already refuses it
 *
 * It refuses it LOUDLY, and that is exactly why the rule needs writing down
 * here. The #3004 transfer gate rejects any payload carrying `owner_id` inside
 * the sharing MIDDLEWARE, upstream of the hook phase, and a screen flow's
 * `update_record` runs as the caller — so an author who adds the column gets a
 * FORBIDDEN at runtime, not a silent drift. A loud failure is the good case; it
 * is also the case nobody meets until a demo, because nothing in `pnpm
 * validate` or `pnpm build` opens a flow node's field map. This file moves the
 * discovery to CI.
 *
 * And there is a second, quieter failure the runtime would NOT catch. A caller
 * who legitimately holds `allowTransfer` passes the gate — and for that caller
 * `case_self_claim` guard 2 ("an explicit `owner_id` in the payload WINS and is
 * never touched") stands down. Adding the column would therefore take the claim
 * seam out of the path on the one caller it could still reach, which is the
 * "second writer of ownership" the ruling forbade in the first place.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — predicted, then measured
 *
 * Predicted direction: RED, naming the node. Measured by adding
 * `owner_id: '{$user.id}'` beside `status` in the `claim` node's field map and
 * running this file: `1 failed` —
 *
 *     claim_case writes ownership itself. Nodes carrying `owner_id`:
 *       claim (update_record).status,owner_id
 *
 * …then removed, and the file is green again. The mutation and its restore were
 * each proven on disk before the run they justify; see the PR body.
 *
 * ## What else is pinned here, and why it belongs beside the ruled assertion
 *
 * **`runAs` is not `system`.** This is the same sentence read from the other
 * end: `case_self_claim` returns early for a write with no user and again for
 * `ctx.session.isSystem`, so an elevated run of this flow moves the status and
 * claims NOTHING — the case leaves triage still ownerless, which is a worse
 * outcome than the refusal above because it looks like it worked. House rule 9
 * says a screen flow stays `runAs: 'user'`; here that is a functional
 * requirement, not a policy preference.
 *
 * **The button's `visible` equals the GRANT.** `case_unassigned_triage_sharing`
 * is what decides whether the agent looking at the button may write the row, so
 * a button offered outside the grant is a button that answers FORBIDDEN. #1145
 * unified every consumer of "no longer live work" on
 * `CLOSED_CASE_STATUSES` and `test/live-work-predicate-parity.test.ts` holds
 * them to it BY NAME — but that roster reaches views, sharing conditions, hook
 * bodies and flow node filters, and an action's `visible` is a fifth surface it
 * has no reader for. Rather than leave a new consumer of the concept unpinned
 * (which is precisely how the original defect grew), the parity is asserted
 * here, against the shipped rule rather than against a copy of its text.
 *
 * **The picker is the seam's own set.** The three claiming statuses are
 * declared once, in `CLAIMABLE_TARGET_STATUSES`, and the screen's options are
 * built from it — so this pins the LABELS, which are the half a constant cannot
 * carry: they must be `crm_case.status`'s own, or the picker offers an agent a
 * word the record page never shows them (#490).

/**
 * Dangling-reference guards for the surfaces that DISPATCH — navigation,
 * actions and dashboards.
 *
 * These are the references whose failure is invisible rather than loud: a nav
 * entry pointing at an object nobody registered renders an empty page, a
 * dashboard header action links to a route that 404s only once someone clicks
 * it, a `rowAction` names an action that does not exist and the menu item
 * simply does nothing. None of it errors at build time, so none of it was
 * noticed until a demo.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Split out of `test/metadata-references.test.ts` by family (#814).
 *
 * That file had grown to 99,872 bytes against the 100KB ceiling in
 * `scripts/check-source-hygiene.mjs` — 97.5% of the quota — so the next PR to
 * add a guard anywhere in it would have been failed by `pnpm hygiene` before
 * it was reviewed. #815 had already been forced into an unplanned split for
 * exactly that reason. The four files now split the guards by the metadata
 * surface they resolve against; this one owns navigation, actions and
 * dashboards.
 *
 * The derivations every one of them shares (`objects`, `views`, `walk`, the
 * locale packs, the platform-object allowlist) live in
 * `test/helpers/metadata-fixtures.ts`. No assertion, helper or fixture changed
 * in the split — see the reconciliation table on the PR.

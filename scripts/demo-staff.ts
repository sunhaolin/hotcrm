// Demo-org staffing (#640) — give the demo org people, so the position-based
// mechanisms this app ships stop resolving to an empty recipient set.
//
//   pnpm dev            # terminal 1 — leave it running
//   pnpm demo:staff     # terminal 2 — once, against that server
//
// It drives a LOCAL, RUNNING dev server through the platform's own admin
// surfaces. Nothing here ships in the artifact: `objectstack.config.ts` never
// imports this file or the table it reads, which is what makes "a real
// deployment installs none of these people" structural rather than hopeful
// (see the header of `src/sharing/demo-staffing.ts`).
//
// Four steps, all idempotent — rerun it any time, including against a
// half-staffed org:
//
//   1. create each person in `DemoOrgStaffing` via
//      POST /api/v1/auth/admin/create-user (better-auth: a REAL, loginable
//      account with a credential and a `sys_member` row — not a raw `sys_user`
//      insert, which ADR-0092's write guard refuses and which would produce an
//      un-loginable row anyway);
//   2. assign the positions they hold (`sys_user_position`);
//   3. HAND THE DEMO BOOK TO THEM (#1759). `demo_bootstrap` claims every
//      ownerless seeded row for the FIRST user — it has to; a seed cannot name
//      a user and that flow ships in the artifact — which leaves the whole
//      book on the dev admin. Invisible over an API key (it runs as the human,
//      so `viewAllRecords` applies) and fatal over OAuth, where the agent
//      ceiling admits only what the caller OWNS or holds a share on
//      (objectstack-ai/objectstack#16549). So a demo salesperson asking their
//      agent about the pipeline got 0 opportunities and 0 tasks. This step
//      re-stamps `owner_id` per the routes in `src/sharing/demo-staffing.ts`;
//      `crm_account` is deliberately NOT among them (see step 5). A row an
//      approval holds locked is REPORTED AND SKIPPED, never fatal — that is
//      what makes the "rerun it any time" line above true (see
//      `Api.patchUnlessLocked`);
//   4. RE-EVALUATE every active sharing rule. This step is not optional and is
//      the reason staffing alone was never enough: `plugin-sharing` materialises
//      grants from a record-write hook that returns early on `isSystem` writes,
//      and every seeded row is written with `isSystem: true`. So the seeded
//      accounts carry no grants no matter who holds a position, until a rule is
//      re-evaluated (boot backfill does it too — this just avoids the restart);
//   5. VERIFY, as each demo user, that the three layers actually connect —
//      plus an OWNERSHIP CENSUS over the routed objects, which is the only
//      evidence that speaks to step 3: the reps must still OWN NO ACCOUNT (a
//      share to an owner proves nothing under a `private` OWD, so owning them
//      would delete the territory demonstration), while every routed row must
//      sit on a demo persona and none of them may hold the lot. Exits non-zero
//      if any of that fails.
//
// Flags: --url (default http://localhost:4001, the port `pnpm dev` binds),
//        --admin-email / --admin-password (default the platform's dev-admin
//        seed, which only exists when NODE_ENV=development).

 * correctly. A row goes to whoever owns its account's TERRITORY, and a row
 * whose account cannot be resolved goes to the manager — so each identity ends
 * up with a SUBSET, which is the demonstration. `crm_account` is not routed at
 * all; see `DemoPipelineOwnership`.
 *
 * ### What it claims, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * Only rows sitting on the DEV ADMIN or on nobody. Those two states are the
 * seed book: `demo_bootstrap` stamps the first user onto everything it finds
 * ownerless, and anything it has not reached yet is still null. A row some LIVE
 * WORKFLOW has already assigned is left exactly where it is — measured on a
 * staffed box, the SLA sweep escalates cases and the escalation hook hands the
 * resulting tasks to the service manager, and re-routing those by territory
 * would overwrite the app demonstrating itself.
 *
 * That also makes the run idempotent and order-independent: correct whether
 * `demo_bootstrap` has already claimed the rows or has not run yet, and a
 * second pass over a converged org writes nothing.
 *
 * ### The one row this cannot move, and why that is not a failure
 *
 * A record under a pending approval is locked (`lockRecord: true` on
 * `opportunity_approval`), so the re-stamp is refused with `409 RECORD_LOCKED`
 * — and the re-stamp is itself an update that can push a $100K+ open deal into
 * approval, which is how a converged org ends up holding such rows at all.
 * `Api.patchUnlessLocked` steps over them and this function reports them in
 * `locked`, because a run that died there left the org half-staffed: no
 * sharing-rule re-evaluation, no census, no verification. ⛔ Never clear the
 * lock to get past it — the decision belongs to the approver, and rerunning
 * after they take it routes the row.

 * Source token ratchet — a shrink-only ceiling on the authored surface (#1183).
 *
 *   node scripts/check-source-token-ratchet.mjs          # the gate (CI runs this)
 *   node scripts/check-source-token-ratchet.mjs --json   # the same measurement, machine-readable
 *
 * ## Why a ceiling
 *
 * HotCRM's headline positioning claim — the entire enterprise CRM fits in a
 * single agent context window — is a number, and an ungated number drifts. It
 * drifted before this gate existed: the README quoted a hand measurement that
 * no longer matched the tree, and nothing anywhere could have noticed. This
 * script is the one place that measurement is defined, so a doc citing it
 * cites a command anyone can re-run instead of someone's afternoon with `wc`.
 *
 * ## What is measured, and why exactly this
 *
 * Maintainer rulings, 2026-08-17 (verbatim, PM session chat):
 *
 *   「translations + seed 肯定是不需要算 token 的」
 *   「我觉得只需要写 业务语义 ~78k 交互层 ~40k ，这样客户更好理解，也更吸引开发者」
 *
 * So the measured surface is `src/**\/*.ts` (excluding `.d.ts`), **minus**
 * `src/translations/` and `src/data/`, comment-stripped and blank-stripped,
 * reported as two headline layers plus the authored total:
 *
 *   - **business semantics** — `src/objects/` `src/flows/` `src/actions/` `src/hooks/`
 *   - **interaction layer**  — `src/views/` `src/pages/` `src/dashboards/` `src/apps/`
 *
 * Translations and seed data are outside the ratchet **entirely**, by ruling: a
 * fifth locale or a richer demo dataset is healthy growth and must never
 * compete with business logic for the budget. They are not measured, not
 * ratcheted, and not reported as debt.
 *
 * The remaining authored directories (datasets, reports, profiles, sharing,
 * skills, mappings, interfaces, …) are not a headline layer — they are printed
 * as a residual and carried in the authored total, which has its own ceiling.
 * Nothing under `src/` can therefore grow unwatched by hiding in a directory
 * that predates or postdates the two headline layers.
 *
 * Because the measure is **comment-stripped**, comment-slimming work (#1184)
 * does not move these numbers. That is deliberate: comments are for the humans
 * and agents reading the repo, and a gate that rewarded deleting them would be
 * a gate against explanation. If a change to this script ever makes comment
 * mass affect the number, the measurement basis has been broken.
 *
 * ## The stripping rule — stated so the number is reproducible and arguable
 *
 * `stripComments()` is a character scanner, not a line matcher. Exactly this,
 * and nothing more:
 *
 *   1. `//` to end of line, and `/* … *\/` however many lines it spans, are
 *      removed — including a trailing comment that follows code on its line.
 *   2. A comment opener inside a string literal (`'…'`, `"…"`, `` `…` ``) or
 *      inside a regular-expression literal is **not** a comment. String and
 *      regex bodies are preserved byte-for-byte, escapes included.
 *   3. `/` is read as a regex literal when the previous significant character
 *      cannot end an expression (`=`, `(`, `,`, `:`, `[`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `?`,
 *      `{`, `}`, `;`, `return`-like positions) and as division otherwise. This
 *      is the standard heuristic; it is ambiguous only after `)`, where this
 *      scanner chooses division.
 *   4. After stripping, lines that are empty or whitespace-only are dropped,
 *      and every retained line is right-trimmed. Leading indentation is
 *      **kept** — it is real input to a model reading the file, and dropping it
 *      would make the number smaller than the thing it claims to measure.
 *   5. `chars` is the length of the retained lines joined with `\n`. `~tokens`
 *      is `chars / 4`, rounded.
 *
 * The line-oriented approximation this replaced (a line is a comment when it
 * starts with `//`, `*` or `/*`) mis-handles both halves of rule 1 and 2. The
 * difference is small on today's tree, but the point of a ratchet is that the
 * *same* rule is applied on every future run, so the rule is written down here
 * and pinned by `test/source-token-ratchet.test.ts`, which asserts it against
 * fixtures for the hazard classes it covers — a comment opener inside a
 * string, a regex literal carrying quote and comment characters, a trailing
 * comment after code, a multi-line block, blank-line collapse.
 *
 * That suite does **not** cross-check this scanner against a compiler, and
 * nothing in this repo does: TypeScript 7's npm package exposes no compiler
 * API, so there is no comment-trivia scanner to borrow. What proved the rule
 * over the *whole real tree* was a one-off hand run against esbuild — every
 * first-party `.ts` file minified twice, once as authored and once
 * comment-stripped, and the two outputs compared byte for byte. That run, its
 * figures, and the reason it is **not** automated here (`esbuild` is not a
 * declared dependency of this repo; it arrives under the ObjectStack CLI) are
 * recorded in that suite's docstring, under the heading
 * "The stripper's equivalence proof is a hand run, recorded here".
 *
 * `typescript` IS a devDependency of this repo, but it belongs to `tsc
 * --noEmit` and is evidence for none of the above — confirming that the
 * dependency exists is not confirming this paragraph. The gate itself imports
 * nothing outside `node:` builtins and `scripts/lib/main-module.mjs`, so it
 * runs with nothing installed and its number cannot move because a compiler
 * upgraded.
 *
 * ## Why `chars / 4` and not a tokenizer
 *
 * Deliberately crude. A ratchet compares like with like — the estimator's
 * absolute accuracy never enters the verdict, only its stability does, and
 * `chars / 4` is perfectly stable and needs no dependency. Adding a real BPE
 * tokenizer would add a third-party runtime dependency to a repo that has none
 * outside `@objectstack/*`, to move a headline number by a few percent in a
 * direction nobody can act on. Measured before writing this: no tokenizer is
 * already available in the dependency graph, so there was no free upgrade to
 * take. If one is ever wanted, it changes the ceilings once and the ratchet
 * continues from there.
 *
 * ## The ratchet discipline (shrink-only, over a 5% working buffer)
 *
 *   - A ceiling may be LOWERED by any PR that shrinks its scope. Lowering is
 *     always legitimate and is the point.
 *   - RAISING one requires a **maintainer ruling quoted in the raising PR's
 *     body**. A feature that would cross a ceiling pays its way by compressing
 *     elsewhere, or by getting an explicit decision that the claim has moved —
 *     which is exactly the conversation the drift-prone number never triggered
 *     on its own.
 *   - Headroom is a **deliberate 5% working buffer**, by maintainer ruling of
 *     2026-08-17: 「给 5% 缓冲」. The first anchor was set flush against the
 *     reading, under 1%, and that was rejected: routine work must not be
 *     interrupted, only real growth should be. So a red run here is not "someone
 *     added a field" — it is "this surface has grown more than 5% past the last
 *     agreed claim", which is worth a conversation.
 *
 * A scope that reads as empty is RED, never a pass: a gate that cannot find its
 * input must fail rather than silently measure nothing.

/**
 * Ceilings, in estimated tokens — and since #1601 there are two KINDS of them.
 *
 * An ANCHORED ceiling is `anchor(reading)`: a reading this gate actually
 * printed, plus the ruled 5% working buffer, rounded up to the next 1,000. It
 * is shrink-only, it moves in the PR that shrinks its own scope, and it owes a
 * worked row below so anyone can re-run the arithmetic.
 *
 * A RULED ceiling is a maintainer grant. It is NOT derived from any reading,
 * so there is no `anchor()` arithmetic to show for it and no worked row that
 * could honestly be written: the only record it can carry is the ruling. Do
 * not reverse-engineer a reading that would produce it — on this layer no real
 * reading can (a reading between 94,286 and 95,238 would be needed to anchor
 * to 100,000, and the tree measures 84,579), so any such row would be a
 * fabricated measurement dressed as arithmetic.
 *
 * `business semantics` became a ruled ceiling on 2026-09-05 (#1601). The
 * ruling, verbatim and untranslated:
 *
 *   「business-semantics 棘轮 提升到 100000」
 *
 * and the shape it was given, from the same exchange, 选项 A:
 *
 *   「解耦:banner 钉实测,ceiling 独立」
 *
 * The grant moved to 115,000 with epic #2 (the project / PSA family: 14
 * objects, their hooks, 9 approval flows and 9 `submit_approval` actions),
 * which reads ~107,507 on this layer — 7.5k past the 100,000 grant. 115,000 is
 * the number proposed in that PR's body for the maintainer to rule on; it is
 * a grant with a working buffer, not `anchor()` of the reading (that would be
 * 113,000, and a ruled ceiling deliberately does not coincide with one). ⛔ If
 * the ruling comes back with a different number, this constant, the row below
 * and the PR body are the three places it lives.
 *
 * The grant moved to 125,000 on 2026-09-15 with the cost-plan rebuild of
 * requirement steps 27–31. The maintainer's ruling, verbatim and untranslated,
 * in the session that ordered the work:
 *
 *   「这块需求不要简化，如何设计？」
 *   「按设计实现。」
 *
 * The design that answered the first line — a versioned plan, four typed line
 * objects, a month ledger, travel standards — reads ~117,865 on this layer,
 * 2.9k past the 115,000 grant; the same instruction is what raised the two
 * anchored ceilings in the same PR. 125,000 is a grant with a working buffer,
 * deliberately not `anchor()` of the reading (that would be 124,000).
 *
 * ⚠️ A ruled ceiling is EXEMPT from this gate's opportunistic-tightening
 * advisory, and since #1607 that exemption is mechanism rather than prose. The
 * advisory offers to re-derive a ceiling from the current reading, which only
 * means something for a ceiling that was derived from a reading in the first
 * place. On this one it was not, and the arithmetic bit: at 84,579 against
 * 100,000 the headroom is over twice the buffer, so every run used to suggest
 * re-anchoring down to ~89,000 — handing back, as the gate's own
 * recommendation, the 15,421 tokens the ruling had just been made to create.
 * So the advisory is now a property of the ANCHORED kind, asked as
 * `isAnchored(label)` at the one place it fires, and the ruled row prints what
 * it is instead of a nag. ⛔ A ruled ceiling is still not tightened on the
 * strength of any advisory line: it moves on another ruling, or on a PR that
 * genuinely shrinks the layer and says so.
 *
 * The anchoring runs the two anchored ceilings below come from:
 *
 *   node scripts/check-source-token-ratchet.mjs   # 2026-08-17 03:20 UTC, `main` at d038b957
 *     #1189 — removed the account renewal fields, their view and their seed values
 *     business semantics ~80,356 · interaction layer ~39,084 · authored total ~133,302
 *
 *   node scripts/check-source-token-ratchet.mjs   # 2026-08-26 06:47 UTC, `main` at d863d547
 *     #1316 — removed the inert `list.tabs[]` block from every view file
 *     business semantics ~82,489 · interaction layer ~37,424 · authored total ~133,840
 *
 *   node scripts/check-source-token-ratchet.mjs   # 2026-09-15 12:40 UTC, `claude/keen-pascal-oaw8w1` at c4220db
 *     business semantics ~117,865 · interaction layer ~47,752 · authored total ~183,687
 *     the cost plan rebuilt without simplification (steps 27–31): 7 objects replace 1, 7 hooks, 7 actions, 1 flow.
 *     This run supersedes the same-day 08:40 run on `demo/psa-presales` at f263c504 (epic #2), which read
 *     107,507 / 47,516 / 172,347 and anchored 50,000 / 181,000.
 *
 * `headroom` is the headroom **at anchor time** (`ceiling - reading`, on that
 * row's own run): it is a derivation of the constant beside it, not a live
 * figure, so it deliberately does not track what the gate prints today — the
 * tree keeps moving between re-anchorings.
 *
 *   business semantics   ruled 125,000 — the maintainer's steps 27–31 ruling (cost plan without simplification), no reading derives it   2026-09-15
 *   interaction layer     47,752 × 1.05 =  50,140 -> ceil 1k ->  51,000  (headroom 3,248, 6.8%)  2026-09-15
 *   authored total       183,687 × 1.05 = 192,871 -> ceil 1k -> 193,000  (headroom 9,313, 5.1%)  2026-09-15
 *
 * The rounding step is what carries the anchored rows a little past 5%; it is
 * kept because a ceiling a reader can hold in their head is worth more than the
 * last few hundred tokens of precision on a number estimated as `chars / 4`.
 *
 * The ruled row is deliberately NOT in the worked-row shape, and that is a
 * measurement in itself: `test/source-token-ratchet.test.ts` pins one worked
 * row per committed ceiling and reads every ceiling as `anchor()` of the
 * reading beside it. That model has no ruled ceiling in it, so it goes red on
 * this row — correctly, and with the message that says teach the shape. ⛔ The
 * fix there is to teach that suite the ruled kind, never to relax the pin and
 * never to fabricate a reading for this row.
 *
 * The latest ANCHORING run (2026-09-15) re-anchored both anchored layers, so
 * no ceiling was left alone by it and there is no declined re-anchoring to
 * work out. When a later run leaves one alone, its worked line goes here —
 * reading, its `anchor()`, and the committed ceiling it would have raised —
 * because re-anchoring it would be a RAISE, and a raise sits on the
 * maintainer floor. A shrink-only ratchet re-anchors a layer only when
 * `anchor(reading) < ceiling`; when it is greater the committed ceiling is
 * already the tighter of the two and stands. `business semantics` has no such
 * line either way: it left the anchored kind entirely at #1601.
 *
 * Lower them whenever the tree shrinks — that is free and encouraged. Raising
 * one requires a maintainer ruling quoted in the raising PR's body. Both of
 * those sentences are about an ANCHORED ceiling, which is a function of the
 * tree: it follows the reading down for free and needs a ruling to go up. A
 * RULED ceiling is not a function of the tree, so it is symmetric — LOWERING
 * one requires a ruling quoted in the lowering PR's body, exactly as raising it
 * does. That is the half no automated suggestion can supply, and the reason
 * this gate stopped offering one.

// Run only when invoked directly. Three suites import from this module, in two
// groups — and the second group is why an edit here is not a local edit.
//
// GROUP 1 — the ceiling figures. Every number derived from a ceiling is
// DERIVED by the test quoting it rather than transcribed beside it:
// `test/source-token-ratchet.test.ts` imports `anchor`, `fmt`, `BUFFER`,
// `CEILINGS` and `CEILING_KINDS` (it sizes its fixtures from
// `CEILINGS`/`BUFFER`, pins the worked table in the header above against
// `anchor()`, and holds that table's ruled/anchored rows to the kinds
// `CEILING_KINDS` declares), and
// `test/docs-readme-token-figures.test.ts` imports `BUFFER` and `CEILINGS` to
// check the README banner. So a re-anchoring moves the constant and the copies
// follow.
//
// GROUP 2 — the stripper. `test/docs-object-term-consistency.test.ts` imports
// `stripComments` and runs every `.ts` file through it to decide what the #802
// Chinese-term guard is allowed to see: a retired spelling may sit in a
// comment, but not in the code. ⇒ EDITING `stripComments` EDITS WHAT THAT
// GUARD SCANS. Strip more than intended and offending literals stop being
// read — the guard then passes by finding nothing, which reads exactly like
// clean. That suite's own defence is a single assertion, that stripping a
// known file leaves its ledger standing; it catches a stripper that returns
// nothing, not one that returns too little. ⛔ So this is not a private
// helper: change it with that suite in hand and re-run it, not just this gate.
//
// `verdict` is exported and imported by nothing. It, and the stripping rule as
// this gate applies it, are also exercised by RUNNING this file:
// `test/source-token-ratchet.test.ts` copies the gate into a sandbox root,
// writes fixtures under it, and asserts the stripped `chars` and the verdict
// text off that real run. No cross-check against a TypeScript scanner is
// involved — not here, and nowhere in this repo; the header paragraph on the
// stripping rule says why.
// Importing must not run the gate or call exit().
//
// ⚠️ The list above is hand-written and nothing holds it to the tree. It was
// re-derived at 57ce720 (2026-09-05). Its predecessor said only two suites
// imported from here and that the stripping rule was never imported: true when
// written (#1380), false three days later when #802 landed the `stripComments`
// importer, and nothing here could notice (#1533). Re-derive before relying on
// it — resolved imports, not name matches:
//
//   grep -rn "from '.*check-source-token-ratchet" test/
//
// `test/deal-threshold-parity.test.ts` declares a local `const stripComments`
// of its own and `test/script-main-guard.test.ts` spawns this file by path;
// neither imports from here, and a name-only grep counts both.
//
// The comparison lives in `scripts/lib/main-module.mjs` and is never
// hand-rolled here: this line used to read
// `import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href`, which is false for
// every invocation through a symlinked path — the gate then measured nothing
// and exited 0 (#1252). See that file for the measurement.

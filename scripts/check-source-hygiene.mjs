/**
 * Source hygiene gate.
 *
 * The console.log / TODO / file-size checks used to live as inline
 * `grep`/`find` one-liners in `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`. All three
 * scanned `packages/` — a directory this repository has never had — and all
 * three carried `continue-on-error: true`, so they reported success without
 * ever reading a single file of ours. The control-byte scan was added later,
 * from #686.
 *
 * They now scan the real source tree and FAIL the build, which is only
 * defensible because the tree is already clean on every count. The
 * copyright-header check came last, from #1094. Running this locally is the
 * same command CI runs:
 *
 *   node scripts/check-source-hygiene.mjs
 *
 * Scope note: `src/` is declarative CRM metadata plus the hook/flow handler
 * bodies that the runtime executes. Diagnostics there belong on `ctx.logger`,
 * which is why `console.log` is banned. `scripts/` is deliberately NOT scanned
 * for `console.log` — those files are CLIs whose entire job is stdout.
 *
 * The checks do not all read the same tree, and that is deliberate — see
 * `SCANNED`, `TEXT_SCANNED` and `ROOT_TEXT_FILES` below. Three checks judge
 * code; the byte-level one judges first-party text wherever it lives (#818,
 * widened again in #838); the header check judges `.ts` only, for the measured
 * reason given at `scanHeaderPosition`. The two `.ts` checks read first-party
 * TypeScript wherever it lives too — the `SCANNED` trees plus the root `.ts`
 * files named in `ROOT_TEXT_FILES` (#1236).

 * Where the size ADVISORY starts, as a fraction of the cap above (#1287).

 * ⛔ This is not a second cap and it is not a lever on the first one. It only
 * decides when a file gets *named* on an otherwise green run; `MAX_FILE_BYTES`
 * is the only thing that can fail this check, and lowering or raising this
 * fraction cannot make an oversized file pass.
 *
 * **Why an advisory exists at all.** The cap is silent at 99% and red at 101%,
 * so the signal always arrived as a failed run on somebody else's change. It
 * had done so three times when this was written — `test/metadata-references.ts`
 * with 817 B of headroom left (#814), `src/data/index.ts` with ~1.5 KB (#635),
 * `test/docs-drift.test.ts` with 2,654 B (#1196, which forced #1187 to re-home
 * its rule mid-implementation). Every one of those is under a *median* commit's
 * worth of growth, i.e. no lead time at all.
 *
 * **Why 70%, measured on `main` @ `7250a1f0` (333 files under `SCANNED`).**
 * Two independent numbers bound the choice, and neither is the 90% the card
 * that asked for this suggested:
 *
 *   - **A band must be wider than one commit, or a file jumps it whole.**
 *     Growth of an already-existing code file in a single commit, over the 53
 *     commits of available history: p50 1,004 B · p90 6,715 B · p95 8,640 B ·
 *     p99 13,703 B · max 13,927 B. A 90% threshold is a 10,240 B band —
 *     *narrower than the largest single commit observed* — so a file can cross
 *     it entirely between two runs and never be named. That reproduces the
 *     silent-then-red failure this check exists to end, 10 KB lower down.
 *   - **The warning has to be seen on one PR and actable on the next**, which
 *     is two touches of headroom: 2 × p99 ≈ 27.4 KB, so the threshold must sit
 *     at or below 73.2%. 70% gives a 30,720 B band — 2.2 × p99, 4.6 × p90,
 *     30.6 × p50 — with margin.
 *
 * **What it costs in noise.** At 70% exactly two of 333 files are named today
 * (`src/translations/es-ES.ts` 75.3%, `src/translations/ja-JP.ts` 73.4%); the
 * tree is otherwise small — median 10,034 B, 323 files under half the cap. Two
 * lines is far inside what this gate already considers readable: `check()`
 * truncates at 20 hits. The opposite error was the real risk. A guard that
 * names nothing is the failure mode this script was written to end — its three
 * original checks scanned `packages/`, a directory this repo has never had, and
 * `SCANNED` carries the verdict in one line: *a check that scans nothing is
 * worse than no check at all*. At the suggested 90%, **zero** of 333 files are
 * named — the advisory would ship watching an empty set.

 * The copyright header must be the first line of every `.ts` file (#1094).
 *
 * The drift did not accrete a typo at a time — it arrived in one batch. All
 * eleven affected files took their displaced import from a single commit,
 * `01da4a8e` (836 files, 2026-08-06), which prepended an `import` line above the
 * header mechanically. Nothing caught it: typecheck, lint and this gate were all
 * green, so it sat in `main` for five days.
 *
 * It then cost two issues and two PRs to clean up by hand. #1091 noticed three
 * of the eleven and fixed those; the sweep it prompted found the other eight
 * within the hour, which became #1094 — a second card, a second review, a second
 * PR, for one commit's worth of drift. Hand-fixing instance twelve buys nothing,
 * because the next bulk edit will land the same way. A gate turns that whole
 * sequence into a red build on the commit that introduces it.
 *
 * So this check is the deliverable, and #1094's eight fixes are what made it
 * green.
 *
 * **What "correct" means here**, and why:
 *
 *   - **The header is line 1.** A licence header that is not the first thing in
 *     the file is not doing its job for any reader or tool that looks at the top
 *     of a file.
 *   - **A shebang may precede it, and nothing else may.** `#!` is the one
 *     construct whose position is load-bearing — the kernel requires it at byte
 *     0. `/* eslint-disable *\/`, `'use strict'` and JSDoc banners all behave
 *     identically one line lower, so none of them earns a place above the
 *     header. (No `.ts` file in this repo has a shebang today; some of the
 *     `.mjs` under `scripts/` do, and where one of those carries the header it
 *     sits on line 2, which is the shape this allows.)
 *   - **A missing header is an error, not out of scope.** Every `.ts` file this
 *     check reads — `allTs`: the `SCANNED` trees plus the root `.ts` files —
 *     carries the header on line 1, so requiring presence costs zero collateral
 *     fixes. That is `scanHeaderPosition`'s own postcondition rather than a
 *     snapshot, which is why no count is quoted. Without presence the check
 *     would police the symptom while leaving the invariant open, since deleting
 *     the header would be a way to satisfy a position-only rule.
 *
 * **Why `.ts` only** (`allTs`, the same predicate the marker check uses, so
 * `.d.ts` is excluded exactly as #1094's own reproduce loop excluded it): the
 * header is universal in `.ts` and is *not* universal in the rest of the
 * scanned trees — some of the `.mjs` under `scripts/`, plus the `.sh` and the
 * `src/docs/*.md` pages, have none. Widening the surface would therefore either
 * demand a header in files this card cannot touch, or force the weaker
 * position-only rule on everyone to accommodate them. Filed separately instead.
 *
 * There is no skip-list and no exemption — a `.ts` file with its header in the
 * wrong place goes red, which is the entire point. Under the scanned trees that
 * needs no list at all: they are walked, so a NEW file is caught the moment it
 * lands. The root is the one place a path list is unavoidable (`walk()`
 * recurses, and the root holds `node_modules` and build output), so root
 * coverage is exactly what `ROOT_TEXT_FILES` names — a new first-class root
 * `.ts` is covered once it is added there, the cost that constant's own
 * docstring states rather than a loophole this check invents. Generated output
 * is already outside the walk (`dist`, `.source`, `.objectstack` are in
 * `SKIP_DIRS`), and no generated `.ts` lives in the scanned trees, so no
 * exemption is invented for a case that does not exist.

/**
 * The surface banner — one line per surface, each count printed beside the
 * checks that consume it (#1339).
 *
 * It used to be one sentence: *"N files under src, test, e2e, scripts, plus 3
 * root .ts file(s) in the marker and header checks"*. That `N` was
 * `codeFiles.length` — **every file type the walk returns** — while the marker
 * and copyright-header checks read `allTs`, which is `.ts` only. So the clause
 * naming those two checks carried a figure counting 14 files neither of them
 * ever opens (340 against `allTs` = 329 when this was written), and a reader
 * taking the sentence at face value got 343 where the truth was 329.
 *
 * ⚠️ The gap is not a stale constant that could be corrected once: it widens on
 * its own. Every non-`.ts` file added anywhere under `SCANNED` moves
 * `codeFiles.length` while `allTs` stands still — #1343 added one
 * (`scripts/lib/source-hygiene-surface.mjs`) and moved it from 13 to 14 without
 * touching this line. The remedy therefore has to be a binding, not a new
 * number.
 *
 * ⛔ And the mis-bound figure is not deletable: `codeFiles.length` is a live
 * reading — it is exactly the set the size cap and its advisory measure — so it
 * keeps its own line, next to those two checks, where it is true. Nothing here
 * is a constant or a snapshot; every figure is interpolated from the same array
 * its checks are handed below, which is what stops the two drifting apart
 * again. `test/source-hygiene-scan-surface.test.ts` asserts that binding on a
 * sandbox built so the `.ts` count and the walk count differ — the old sentence
 * goes red there.
 *
 * ⛔ Nothing below may reach for a count of its own. A figure computed here
 * rather than read off the array the check receives is the defect this comment
 * is about, re-introduced.

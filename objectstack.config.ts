// ─── Which SHAPE of HotCRM this build assembles (#1361) ───────────────────
//
// `default` (unset, or `HOTCRM_COMPOSITION=default`) is the community app and
// is byte-for-byte what it always was — every field below that a composition
// touches falls through to the same value it had before this knob existed.
// `HOTCRM_COMPOSITION=saas` assembles the shape a multi-org operator deploys on
// the enterprise runtime under a walled tenancy posture; an unrecognised value
// throws here rather than quietly assembling the wrong app (see
// `resolveComposition`).
//
// The knob is deliberately COMPOSITION-time and uniform. The platform's
// `seed-replayer` gives every newly founded organization its own private copy
// of the registered dataset union (maintainer ruling 2026-08-27,
// objectstack#12701: 「种子也不应该是全局的呀 …只是参考呀，租户要自己删除呀」),
// but it has no per-family or per-tenant selection and none is chartered — so
// WHAT gets replayed is decided once, here, for every tenant alike.
//
// Three things change, and nothing else. There is no runtime branch anywhere in
// `src/`, and no enterprise package is imported: an artifact built either way
// runs on the community runtime.
//
//  1. `data` — the catalogue family only. See `SaasTenantSeedData`.
//  2. `flows` — `demo_bootstrap` is dropped. It is a DEMO sweep (its own header
//     says so) and under the wall it is actively wrong, not merely useless: it
//     runs `runAs: 'system'`, and a system context is the one context the
//     organization predicate does not apply to. Measured on a real engine under
//     `OS_TENANCY_POSTURE=isolated` — the sweep's own shape, a system-context
//     select of ownerless rows followed by an owner stamp, sees rows in EVERY
//     organization and writes org A's first user onto org B's row. That is an
//     identity crossing the wall. `test/saas-composition.test.ts` reproduces it
//     rather than asserting it in prose. (It is also redundant in this shape:
//     the catalogue's `crm_product` declares no `owner_id`, so a catalog-only
//     tenant has nothing ownerless for the sweep to claim.)
//     `demo-staffing` needs no exclusion — `src/sharing/demo-staffing.ts` is
//     deliberately not exported from `src/sharing/index.js` and not registered
//     in any composition (#640, pinned by `test/demo-staffing.test.ts`).
//  3. `permissions` — `system_admin` is replaced by `tenant_admin`, which holds
//     org-scoped `manage_org_users` instead of platform-scope `manage_users`.
//     Read `src/profiles/tenant-admin.profile.ts` for the full audit, including
//     what `view_all_data` / `modify_all_data` mean under the wall.
//     `positions` makes the SAME swap, and is part of this one change rather
//     than a fourth: a pure-metadata app binds a set to a position only by
//     declaring a position of the same name, so registering `tenant_admin` as a
//     set while registering `system_admin` as a position would leave the set
//     unreachable and the position empty — both halves of #488 at once. See
//     `src/sharing/positions.ts`.
const composition = resolveComposition();

/**
 * Flows this composition registers.
 *
 * Filtered by IDENTITY, not by name string: renaming `demo_bootstrap` must not

 * removed exactly one flow, so a refactor that makes it match nothing is red.

    engines: { protocol: '^17.4.0' },
  },

  // ─── Platform capabilities this app needs ─────────────────────────
  // The runtime resolves each capability name to a built-in service plugin
  // and auto-loads it (with extras like Automation's node packs). No need
  // to hand-instantiate plugins or pass `--preset` flags. See
  // packages/cli/src/commands/serve.ts CAPABILITY_PROVIDERS for the
  // complete map; explicit `plugins: [...]` always shadows the resolver.
  // `auth` enables the auth/login surface (login/register) via @objectstack/plugin-auth.
  // `ui`   serves the unified Console shell and CRM apps under /_console/
  //        (login at /_console/login). ObjectStack 7.x replaced the legacy
  //        /_studio/ and /_account/ mounts with this single /_console/ surface.
  // Both are required for a clickable login flow when running `objectstack start`
  // off the compiled artifact.
  // Note: the foundational slate (queue, job, cache, settings, email,
  // storage) is auto-injected by the CLI for every non-`minimal`
  // preset — see `ALWAYS_CAPS` in packages/cli/src/commands/serve.ts.
  // Listed below only the *opt-in* capabilities this stack actually
  // wants on top of that slate.
  // `triggers` installs the record-change + schedule trigger providers that
  // actually fire autolaunched flows (record_change & schedule types). Without
  // it the `automation` engine registers flows but nothing ever launches them.
  // Schedule triggers run via the job service (in the always-on slate).
  //
  // `ai` is deliberately NOT listed. ObjectStack 11.3.0 (ADR-0025 S2) removed
  // `@objectstack/service-ai` from the open edition — the AI runtime now ships
  // only in the closed cloud package, and the framework CLI does not depend on
  // it. Under ObjectStack 16, `requires: ['ai']` is a *fail-fast* capability:
  // the serve command hard-aborts boot when the package is absent, so keeping it
  // here would break `objectstack start`/`dev` for this open-edition app (the AI
  // block runs before every other capability resolves). The AI metadata is
  // unaffected — the skills still validate, build into the artifact, and run
  // wherever a runtime provides the `ai` tier (cloud's objectos-runtime). There
  // are no app-authored agents: they were retired in #512 and the surface is
  // skills-only (ADR-0063 §2); skills attach to a platform agent by `surface`.
  // A local open-edition boot simply omits the AI service and hides its console
  // surface. To run AI locally, declare `@objectstack/service-ai` (cloud) in
  // package.json — its mere presence best-effort auto-loads it.
  // `hierarchy-security` is the ONE enterprise-edition capability this app
  // declares (#880). `sales_manager` authors `writeScope: 'own_and_reports'` on
  // `crm_contract`, an ADR-0057 HIERARCHY scope resolved by the
  // `hierarchy-scope-resolver` service that ships only in
  // `@objectstack/security-enterprise`. Declaring the capability is REQUIRED to
  // author that scope at all — `defineStack` refuses the grant outright without
  // it — and the pair is one declaration: move them together or not at all.
  //
  // Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-11, verbatim: 「本项目是元数据app，在企业版运行就
  // 具备企业版相关的能力，不重复开发。」 The app states what it MEANS and the
  // edition supplies the capability, rather than approximating it with a broader
  // open-edition value.
  //
  // UNLIKE `ai` above, this is SAFE to declare on an open-edition boot and does
  // NOT fail fast. Verified against `@objectstack/cli`'s serve command: the
  // capability resolver looks the token up in `CAPABILITY_PROVIDERS`, finds no
  // entry, and because `hierarchy-security` IS in the known
  // `PLATFORM_CAPABILITY_TOKENS` vocabulary it takes the deliberate "stay quiet"
  // branch — no warning, no abort — since the capability arrives via an explicit
  // enterprise plugin in `plugins[]`. Only tier-gated tokens (ai / ai-studio /
  // i18n / ui / auth) have the dedicated hard-abort blocks the note above
  // describes. `objectstack validate` does print one informational line naming
  // the package to install; that is expected output, asserted by
  // `test/contract-write-depth.test.ts`, not a defect to silence.
  //
  // What an OPEN-edition boot gets: the resolver is absent, so the scope fails
  // CLOSED to owner-only and a Sales Manager still cannot edit a rep's contract.
  // That is an edition boundary, and the docs say so per edition.
